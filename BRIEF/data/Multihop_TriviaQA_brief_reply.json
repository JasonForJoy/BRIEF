When Cassiopeia's hubris leads her to boast that Andromeda is more beautiful than the Nereids, Poseidon sends the sea monster Cetus to ravage Andromeda as divine punishment. Andromeda is chained to a rock as a sacrifice to sate the monster, but is saved from death by Perseus. Her name is the Latinized form of the Greek (\"Androm\u00e9da\") or (\"Androm\u00e9d\u0113\"): \"ruler of men\", from (\"an\u0113r, andr\u00f3s\") \"man\", and \"medon\", \"ruler\".

In Greek mythology, Andromeda was the daughter of Cepheus and Cassiopeia, king and queen of the African kingdom of Aethiopia.

Chemistry was preceded by its protoscience, alchemy, which is an intuitive but non-scientific approach to understanding the constituents of matter and their interactions. It was unsuccessful in explaining the nature of matter and its transformations, but, by performing experiments and recording the results, alchemists set the stage for modern chemistry. Chemistry as a body of knowledge distinct from alchemy began to emerge when a clear differentiation was made between them by Robert Boyle in his work \"The Sceptical Chymist\" (1661). While both alchemy and chemistry are concerned with matter and its transformations, the crucial difference was\nand occultism into the study of natural substances with the ultimate goal of transmuting elements into gold and discovering the elixir of eternal life. Work, particularly the development of distillation, continued in the early Byzantine period with the most famous practitioner being the 4th century Greek-Egyptian Zosimos of Panopolis. Alchemy continued to be developed and practised throughout the Arab world after the Muslim conquests, and from there, and from the Byzantine remnants, diffused into medieval and Renaissance Europe through Latin translations. Some influential Muslim chemists, Ab\u016b al-Rayh\u0101n al-B\u012br\u016bn\u012b, Avicenna and Al-Kindi refuted the theories of alchemy, particularly the theory of\nproperties of the soil on the moon (astrophysics), how medications work (pharmacology), and how to collect DNA evidence at a crime scene (forensics). The word \"chemistry\" comes from \"alchemy,\" which referred to an earlier set of practices that encompassed elements of chemistry, metallurgy, philosophy, astrology, astronomy, mysticism and medicine.

A British political resident noted that\nDoha's economy is built primarily on the revenue the country has made from its oil and natural gas industries. Beginning in the late 20th century, the government launched numerous initiatives to diversify the country's economy in order to decrease its dependence on oil and gas resources.

Zeus was furious and decreed that she would never marry an immortal. According to the \"Achilleid\", written by Statius in the 1st century AD, and to non-surviving previous sources, when Achilles was born Thetis tried to make him immortal by dipping him in the river Styx. However, he was left vulnerable at the part of the body by which she held him: his left heel (see Achilles' heel, Achilles' tendon). It is not clear if this version of events was known earlier. In another version of this story, Thetis anointed the boy in\nthe water of the magical river. Achilles grew up to be a man of war who survived many great battles. One day, a poisonous arrow shot at him was lodged in his heel, killing him shortly afterwards. The death of Achilles was not mentioned in Homer's \"Iliad\", but appeared in later Greek and Roman poetry and drama concerning events after the Iliad, later in the Trojan War.

Achilles' most notable feat during the Trojan War was the slaying of the Trojan hero Hector outside the gates of Troy.

Angry at the dishonour of having his plunder and glory taken away (and, as he says later, because he loves Briseis), with the urging of his mother Thetis, Achilles refuses to fight or lead his troops alongside the other Greek forces.

        "text": "loyalty to her absent husband. It suited the marital aspect of Roman society representing the tranquility of the worthy family. She is mentioned by various classical authors including Plautus, Propertius, Horace, Ovid, Martial and Statius. The use of Penelope in Latin texts provided a basis for her ongoing use in the Middle Ages and Renaissance as a representation of the chaste wife. This was reinforced by her being named by Saint Jerome among pagan women famed for their chastity. Penelope In Homer's \"Odyssey\", Penelope ( ; , \"P\u0113nel\u00f3peia\", or , \"P\u0113nel\u00f3p\u0113\") is the wife of Odysseus, who is known for\nPenelope In Homer's \"Odyssey\", Penelope ( ; , \"P\u0113nel\u00f3peia\", or , \"P\u0113nel\u00f3p\u0113\") is the wife of Odysseus, who is known for her fidelity to Odysseus while he was absent, despite having many suitors. Her name has therefore been traditionally associated with marital fidelity. The origin of her name is believed by Robert S. P. Beekes to be Pre-Greek and related to \"p\u0113nelops\" (\u03c0\u03b7\u03bd\u03ad\u03bb\u03bf\u03c8) or \"p\u0113nel\u014dps\" (\u03c0\u03b7\u03bd\u03ad\u03bb\u03c9\u03c8), glossed by Hesychius as \"some kind of bird\" (today arbitrarily identified with the Eurasian wigeon, to which Linnaeus gave the binomial \"Anas penelope\"), where \"-el\u014dps\" (-\u03ad\u03bb\u03c9\u03c8) is a common Pre-Greek suffix for predatory animals;\nhowever, the semantic relation between the proper name and the gloss is not clear. In folk etymology, \"P\u0113nelop\u0113\" (\u03a0\u03b7\u03bd\u03b5\u03bb\u03cc\u03c0\u03b7) is usually understood to combine the Greek word \"p\u0113n\u0113\" (\u03c0\u03ae\u03bd\u03b7), \"weft\", and \"\u014dps\" (\u1f64\u03c8), \"face\", which is considered the most appropriate for a cunning weaver whose motivation is hard to decipher. Penelope is the wife of the main character, the king of Ithaca, Odysseus (Ulysses in Roman mythology), and daughter of Icarius of Sparta and his wife Periboea. She only has one son by Odysseus, Telemachus, who was born just before Odysseus was called to fight in the Trojan War. She\nand Telemachus, wisely ruling his kingdom and enjoying wide respect and much success. In some early sources such as Pindar, Pan's father is Apollo via Penelope. Herodotus (2.145), Cicero (\"ND\" 3.22.56), Apollodorus (7.38) and Hyginus (\"Fabulae\" 224) all make Hermes and Penelope his parents. Pausanias 8.12.5 records the story that Penelope had in fact been unfaithful to her husband, who banished her to Mantineia upon his return. 5th-century AD source \"Dionysiaca\" by Nonnus (14.92) names Penelope of Mantineia in Arcadia Pan's mother. Other sources (Duris of Samos; the Vergilian commentator Servius) report that Penelope slept with all 108 suitors in\nOdysseus' absence, and gave birth to Pan as a result. This myth reflects the folk etymology that equates Pan's name (\u03a0\u03ac\u03bd) with the Greek word for \"all\" (\u03c0\u1fb6\u03bd). Penelope is recognizable in Greek and Roman works, from Attic vase-paintings\u2014the Penelope Painter is recognized by his representations of her\u2014to Roman sculpture copying or improvising upon classical Greek models, by her seated pose, by her reflective gesture of leaning her cheek on her hand, and by her protectively crossed knees, reflecting her long chastity in Odysseus' absence, an unusual pose in any other figure.

This appraisal originated in Pierre Gassendi's 1654 biography, \"Tychonis Brahe, equitis Dani, astronomorum coryphaei, vita\".

In the twentieth century, literary scholar Kermit Vanderbilt noted, \"Increasingly rare is the scholar who braves ridicule to justify the art of Longfellow's popular rhymings.\" Twentieth-century poet Lewis Putnam Turco concluded that \"Longfellow was minor and derivative in every way throughout his career ... nothing more than a hack imitator of the English Romantics.\" Sources Other Henry Wadsworth Longfellow Henry Wadsworth Longfellow (February 27, 1807 \u2013 March 24, 1882) was an American poet and educator whose works include \"Paul Revere's Ride\", \"The Song of Hiawatha\", and \"Evangeline\". He was\n\"among the first of our American poets\". Poet John Greenleaf Whittier said that Longfellow's poetry illustrated \"the careful moulding by which art attains the graceful ease and chaste simplicity of nature\". Longfellow's friend Oliver Wendell Holmes, Sr. wrote of him as \"our chief singer\" and one who \"wins and warms ... kindles, softens, cheers [and] calms the wildest woe and stays the bitterest tears!\" The rapidity with which American readers embraced Longfellow was unparalleled in publishing history in the United States; by 1874, he was earning $3,000 per poem. His popularity spread throughout Europe, as well, and his poetry was\nis depicted as bedtime for a cranky child. Many of the metaphors that he used in his poetry came from legends, mythology, and literature. He was inspired, for example, by Norse mythology for \"The Skeleton in Armor\" and by Finnish legends for \"The Song of Hiawatha\". Longfellow rarely wrote on current subjects and seemed detached from contemporary American concerns. Even so, he called for the development of high quality American literature, as did many others during this period. In \"Kavanagh\", a character says: We want a national literature commensurate with our mountains and rivers ... We want a national epic\nnever attributed to anything but the irritation of a sensitive nature chafed by some indefinite sense of wrong\". Margaret Fuller judged Longfellow \"artificial and imitative\" and lacking force. Poet Walt Whitman also considered him an imitator of European forms, though he praised his ability to reach a popular audience as \"the expressor of common themes\u2014of the little songs of the masses\". He added, \"Longfellow was no revolutionarie: never traveled new paths: of course never broke new paths.\" Lewis Mumford said that Longfellow could be completely removed from the history of literature without much effect. Toward the end of his life,\nthe \"Boston Evening Transcript\" wrote in 1846, \"Whatever the miserable envy of trashy criticism may write against Longfellow, one thing is most certain, no American poet is more read\". Longfellow was the most popular poet of his day. As a friend once wrote, \"no other poet was so fully recognized in his lifetime\". Many of his works helped shape the American character and its legacy, particularly with the poem \"Paul Revere's Ride\". He was such an admired figure in the United States during his life that his 70th birthday in 1877 took on the air of a national holiday, with",

        "text": "The Hay Wain The Hay Wain is a painting by John Constable, finished in 1821, which depicts a rural scene on the River Stour between the English counties of Suffolk and Essex. It hangs in the National Gallery in London and is regarded as \"Constable's most famous image\" and one of the greatest and most popular English paintings. Painted in oils on canvas, the work depicts as its central feature three horses pulling what in fact appears to be a wood wain or large farm cart across the river. Willy Lott's Cottage, also the subject of an eponymous painting by\nConstable, is visible on the far left. The scene takes place near Flatford Mill in Suffolk, though since the Stour forms the border of two counties, the left bank is in Suffolk and the landscape on the right bank is in Essex. \"The Hay Wain\" is one of a series of paintings by Constable called the \"six-footers\", large-scale canvasses which he painted for the annual summer exhibitions at the Royal Academy. As with all of the paintings in this series Constable produced a full-scale oil sketch for the work; this is now in the Victoria and Albert Museum in London.\nHay Wain\" is revered today as one of the greatest British paintings, when it was originally exhibited at the Royal Academy in 1821 (under the title \"Landscape: Noon\"), it failed to find a buyer. It was considerably better received in France where it was praised by Th\u00e9odore G\u00e9ricault. The painting caused a sensation when it was exhibited with other works by Constable at the 1824 Paris Salon (it has been suggested that the inclusion of Constable's paintings in the exhibition was a tribute to G\u00e9ricault, who died early that year). In that exhibition, \"The Hay Wain\" was singled out for\nAssociate of the Royal Academy. In 1821 he showed \"The Hay Wain\" (a view from Flatford Mill) at the Academy's exhibition. Th\u00e9odore G\u00e9ricault saw it on a visit to London and praised Constable in Paris, where a dealer, John Arrowsmith, bought four paintings, including \"The Hay Wain.\" It was exhibited at the Paris Salon of 1824, winning a gold medal. Of Constable's colour, Delacroix wrote in his journal: \"What he says here about the green of his meadows can be applied to every tone\". Delacroix repainted the background of his 1824 \"Massacre de Scio\" after seeing the Constables at Arrowsmith's\na gold medal awarded by Charles X of France, a cast of which is incorporated into the picture's frame. The works by Constable in the exhibition inspired a new generation of French painters, including Eug\u00e8ne Delacroix.

A lyrical fusion of samba and jazz, bossa nova acquired a large following in the 1960s, initially among young musicians and college students. In Brazil, the word \"bossa\" is an old-fashioned slang for something that is done with particular charm, natural flair or innate ability. As early as 1932, Noel Rosa used the word in a samba:\nThe exact origin of the term \"bossa nova\" remained unclear for many decades, according to some authors. Within the artistic beach culture of the late 1950s in Rio de Janeiro, the term \"bossa\" was used to refer to any new \"trend\" or \"fashionable wave\". In his book \"Bossa Nova\", Brazilian author Ruy Castro asserts that \"bossa\" was already in use in the 1950s by musicians as a word to characterize someone's knack for playing or singing idiosyncratically. Castro claims that the term \"bossa nova\" might have first been used in public for a concert given in 1957 by the Grupo\nthe singing voice. Prior to bossa nova, Brazilian singers employed brassy, almost operatic styles. Now, the characteristic nasal vocal production of bossa nova is a peculiar trait of the caboclo folk tradition of northeastern Brazil. The lyrical themes found in bossa nova include women, love, longing, homesickness, nature. Bossa Nova was often apolitical. The musical lyrics of the late 1950s depicted the easy life of the middle to upper-class Brazilians, though the majority of the population was in the working class.

Bossa nova was also influenced by the blues, but because the most famous bossa novas lack the 12-bar structure characteristic of classic blues, as well as the statement, repetition and rhyming resolution of lyrics typical of the genre, bossa nova's affinity with the blues often passes unnoticed.

The VS-300 was the first successful single lifting rotor helicopter in the United States and the first successful helicopter to use a single vertical-plane tail rotor configuration for antitorque. With floats attached, it became the first practical amphibious helicopter. Igor Sikorsky's quest for a practical helicopter began in 1938, when as the Engineering Manager of the Vought-Sikorsky Division\nwas found that the VS-300 could not fly forward easily and Sikorsky joked about turning the pilot's seat around. Sikorsky fitted utility floats (also called pontoons) to the VS-300 and performed a water landing and takeoff on 17 April 1941, making it the first practical amphibious helicopter. On 6 May 1941, the VS-300 beat the world endurance record held by the Focke-Wulf Fw 61, by staying aloft for 1 hour 32 minutes and 26.1 seconds.

In developing the concept of rotary-wing flight, Sikorsky was the first to introduce a single engine to power both the main and tail rotor systems.

For later flights of his VS-300, Sikorsky also added a vertical airfoil surface to the end of the tail to assist anti-torque but this was later removed when it proved to be ineffective.

In Greek mythology, she is a daughter of Kronos and Rhea. Hestia received the first offering at every sacrifice in the household. In the public domain, the hearth of the \"prytaneum\" functioned as her official sanctuary. With the establishment of a new colony, flame from Hestia's public hearth in the mother city would be carried to the new settlement. Her Roman equivalent is Vesta; Herodotus equates the Scythian\nmaintain Hestia's public fire in her temple or shrine was a breach of duty to the broad community. A hearth fire might be deliberately, ritually extinguished at need, and its lighting or relighting should be accompanied by rituals of completion, purification and renewal, comparable with the rituals and connotations of an eternal flame and of sanctuary lamps. At the level of the \"polis\", the hearths of Greek colonies and their mother cities were allied and sanctified through Hestia's cult. Hestia's nearest Roman equivalent, Vesta, had similar functions as a divine personification of Rome's \"public\", domestic, and colonial hearths, and bound\nTabiti with her. Hestia's name means \"hearth, fireplace, altar\", stemming from the same root as the English verbal form \"was\" (PIE \"*h\u2082wes-\" \"to live, dwell, pass the night\"). It thus refers to the \"oikos\", the household, house, or family. \"An early form of the temple is the hearth house; the early temples at Dreros and Prinias on Crete are of this type as indeed is the temple of Apollo at Delphi which always had its inner \"hestia\"\".

It has been applied to social welfare economics, the crisis of global poverty, the ethics of raising animals for food and the importance of avoiding existential risks to humanity. Benthamism, the utilitarian philosophy founded by Jeremy Bentham, was substantially modified by his successor John Stuart Mill, who popularized the word 'Utilitarianism'. In 1861, Mill acknowledged in a footnote that, though \"believing himself to be the first person who brought the word 'utilitarian' into use, he did not invent it. Rather, he adopted it from a passing expression in\"\nUtilitarianism Utilitarianism is an ethical and philosophical theory that states that the best action is the one that maximizes utility, which is usually defined as that which produces the greatest well-being of the greatest number of people, and in some cases, sentient animals. Jeremy Bentham, the founder of utilitarianism, described utility as the sum of all pleasure that results from an action, minus the suffering of anyone involved in the action. Utilitarianism is a version of consequentialism, which states that the consequences of any action are the only standard of right and wrong. Unlike other forms of consequentialism, such as\nmedieval world, like the state consequentialism of Mohism or the political philosophy of Niccol\u00f2 Machiavelli. Mohist consequentialism advocated communitarian moral goods including political stability, population growth, and wealth, but did not support the utilitarian notion of maximizing individual happiness. Machiavelli was also an exponent of consequentialism. He believed that the actions of a state, however cruel or ruthless they may be, must contribute towards the common good of a society. Utilitarianism as a distinct ethical position only emerged in the eighteenth century. Although utilitarianism is usually thought to start with Jeremy Bentham, there were earlier writers who presented theories that\nthinker and that the philosophical part of his treatise on ethics is \"an assemblage of ideas developed by others and is presented to be learned by students rather than debated by colleagues.\" Nevertheless, his book \"The Principles of Moral and Political Philosophy\" (1785) was a required text at Cambridge and Smith says that Paley's writings were \"once as well known in American colleges as were the readers and spellers of William McGuffey and Noah Webster in the elementary schools.\" Although now largely missing from the philosophical canon, Schneewind writes that \"utilitarianism first became widely known in England through the work\nhappiness of the greatest numbers\u2014and the worst is the one that causes the most misery. In the first three editions of the book, Hutcheson included various mathematical algorithms \"...to compute the Morality of any Actions.\" In this, he pre-figured the hedonic calculus of Bentham. Some claim that John Gay developed the first systematic theory of utilitarian ethics. In \"Concerning the Fundamental Principle of Virtue or Morality\" (1731), Gay argues that: This pursuit of happiness is given a theological basis: Gay's theological utilitarianism was developed and popularized by William Paley.

The Italian libretto was written by Francesco Maria Piave based on the play \"Le roi s'amuse\" by Victor Hugo. Despite serious initial problems with the Austrian censors who had control over northern Italian theatres at the time, the opera had a triumphant premiere at La Fenice in Venice on 11 March 1851. It is widely considered to be the first of the operatic masterpieces of Verdi's middle-to-late career. Its tragic story revolves around the licentious Duke of Mantua, his hunch-backed court jester Rigoletto, and Rigoletto's beautiful daughter Gilda.\npremi\u00e8re, La Fenice had cast Felice Varesi as Rigoletto, the young tenor Raffaele Mirate as the Duke, and Teresa Brambilla as Gilda (although Verdi would have preferred Teresa De Giuli Borsi). Due to a high risk of unauthorised copying, Verdi demanded extreme secrecy from all his singers and musicians, particularly Mirate: the \"Duke\" had the use of his score for only a few evenings before the premi\u00e8re, and was made to swear that he would not sing or even whistle the tune of \"La donna \u00e8 mobile\" except during rehearsal. 19th-century productions \"Rigoletto\" premiered on 11 March 1851 in a\nthe death of his mother in June 1851.

One of Hardy's Wessex novels, it is set in a fictional rural England with Casterbridge standing in for Dorchester in Dorset where the author spent his youth. It was first published as a weekly serialisation from January 1886. The novel is considered to be one of the Hardy's masterpieces, although it has been criticised for incorporating too many incidents: a consequence of the author trying to include something in every weekly published instalment.\nThomas Hardy Thomas Hardy (2 June 1840 \u2013 11 January 1928) was an English novelist and poet. A Victorian realist in the tradition of George Eliot, he was influenced both in his novels and in his poetry by Romanticism, especially William Wordsworth. He was highly critical of much in Victorian society, especially on the declining status of rural people in Britain, such as those from his native South West England. While Hardy wrote poetry throughout his life and regarded himself primarily as a poet, his first collection was not published until 1898. Initially, therefore, he gained fame as the author\nChanged Man and Other Tales\" (1913). His works have been collected as the 24-volume Wessex Edition (1912\u201313) and the 37-volume Mellstock Edition (1919\u201320). His largely self-written biography appears under his second wife's name in two volumes from 1928 to 1930, as \"The Early Life of Thomas Hardy, 1840\u201391\" and \"The Later Years of Thomas Hardy, 1892\u20131928\", now published in a critical one-volume edition as \"The Life and Work of Thomas Hardy\", edited by Michael Millgate (1984).

The venue is named after the French aviator Roland Garros. It is the premier clay court tennis championship event in the world and the second of four annual Grand Slam tournaments, the other three being the Australian Open, Wimbledon and the US Open. The French Open is currently the only Grand Slam event held on clay, and it is the zenith of the spring clay court season. Because\nof the seven rounds needed for a championship, the slow-playing surface and the best-of-five-set men's singles matches (without a tiebreak in the final set), the event is widely considered to be the most physically demanding tennis tournament in the world. Officially named in French \"Championnats Internationaux de France de tennis\" and \"Tournoi de Roland-Garros\" (the \"French International Championships of Tennis\" or \"Roland Garros Tournament\" in English), the tournament is referred to in English as the \"French Open\" and alternatively as \"Roland Garros\", which is the designation used by the tournament itself in all languages.

Plans to renovate and expand Roland Garros have put aside any such consideration, and the tournament remains in its long time home. Clay courts slow down the ball and produce a high bounce when compared to grass courts or hard courts. For this reason, clay courts take away some of the advantages of big servers and serve-and-volleyers, which makes it hard for these types of players to dominate on the surface.

His works include operas, ballets, chamber music, secular and religious vocal pieces and orchestral compositions including nine symphonies, written over sixty years. Strongly influenced by Tudor music and English folk-song, his output marked a decisive break in British music from its German-dominated style of the 19th century. Vaughan Williams was born to a well-to-do family with strong moral views and a progressive social outlook. Throughout his life he sought to be of service to his fellow citizens, and believed in making music as\nof a condensed radio adaptation, originally presented in 1942 and starring John Gielgud, which included, as background music, several excerpts from Vaughan Williams' orchestral works. The book was the basis of \"The Pilgrim's Progress (opera)\" by Ralph Vaughan Williams, premiered in 1951. The radio version was newly recorded by Hyperion Records in 1990, in a performance conducted by Matthew Best. It again starred Gielgud, and featured Richard Pasco and Ursula Howells. English composer Ernest Austin set the whole story as a huge narrative tone poem for solo organ, with optional 6-part choir and narrator, lasting approximately 2\u00bd hours. Under the\npremiered at a Royal Philharmonic Society concert conducted by Sir Malcolm Sargent in April 1958, puzzled critics with its sombre, questing tone, and did not immediately achieve the recognition it later gained. Having been in excellent health, Vaughan Williams died suddenly in the early hours of 26 August 1958 at Hanover Terrace, aged 85. Two days later, after a private funeral at Golders Green, he was cremated. On 19 September, at a crowded memorial service, his ashes were interred near the burial plots of Purcell and Stanford in the north choir aisle of Westminster Abbey.

In the same year Vaughan Williams's last opera, \"The Pilgrim's Progress\", was staged at Covent Garden as part of the Festival of Britain.

Marsala first received \"Denominazione di Origine Controllata\" (DOC) status in 1969. The DOC status is equivalent to PDO: most countries limit the use of the term \"Marsala\" to those wines that come from the Marsala area, to which the European Union grants Protected Designation of Origin (PDO) status.

A typical savory Marsala sauce, for example, involves reducing the wine almost to a syrup with onions or shallots, then adding mushrooms and herbs. One of the most popular Marsala recipes is chicken marsala, in which flour-coated pounded chicken breast halves are braised in a mixture of Marsala, butter, olive oil, mushrooms, and spices. Marsala is also used in some risotto recipes. Sweet Marsala wine is used to produce rich Italian desserts such as \"zabaglione\", tiramisu and shortcake. Marsala wine\nPalermitano by adoption, bought up great swathes of land between the two largest established Marsala producers and set to making his own vintage with even more exclusive range of grape. Florio purchased Woodhouse's firm, among others, in the late nineteenth century and consolidated the Marsala wine industry. Florio and Pellegrino remain the leading producers of Marsala today. Marsala is produced using the Grillo, Inzolia, Catarratto and Damaschino white grape varietals, among others. Marsala contains about 15\u201320% alcohol by volume. Different Marsala wines are classified according to their color, sweetness, and the duration of their aging. The three levels of sweetness\nit would last on long ocean voyages, but now it is made that way because of its popularity in foreign markets. The most credible version of the introduction of Marsala fortified wine to a wider range of consumers is attributed to the English trader John Woodhouse. In 1773, Woodhouse landed at the port of Marsala and discovered the local wine produced in the region, which was aged in wooden casks and tasted similar to Spanish and Portuguese fortified wines then popular in England. Fortified Marsala was, and is, made using a process called \"in perpetuum\", which is similar to the\nare \"secco\" (with a maximum 40 grams of residual sugar per liter), \"semisecco\" (41\u2013100 g/l) and \"sweet\" (over 100 g/l). The color and aging classifications are as follows: Marsala wine was traditionally served as an aperitif between the first and second courses of a meal. Contemporary diners will serve its drier versions chilled with Parmesan (stravecchio), Gorgonzola, Roquefort, and other spicy cheeses, with fruits or pastries, and the sweeter at room temperature as a dessert wine.

After Germany's defeat in 1945, Eichmann was captured by US forces, but escaped from a detention camp and moved around Germany to avoid re-capture.

The following example is a limerick of unknown origin: The form appeared in England in the early years of the 18th century.

The most prized limericks incorporate a kind of twist, which may be revealed in the final line or lie in the way the rhymes are often intentionally tortured, or both. Many limericks show some form of internal rhyme, alliteration or assonance, or some element of word play. Verses in limerick form are sometimes combined with a refrain to form a limerick song, a traditional humorous drinking song often with obscene verses. David Abercrombie, a phonetician, takes a different view of the limerick, and one which seems to accord better with the form. It is this: Lines one,\ntrue limerick as a folk form is always obscene, and cites similar opinions by Arnold Bennett and George Bernard Shaw, describing the clean limerick as a \"periodic fad and object of magazine contests, rarely rising above mediocrity\". From a folkloric point of view, the form is essentially transgressive; violation of taboo is part of its function.

Footnotes Notes Bibliography Charles Dickens Charles John Huffam Dickens (; 7 February 1812 \u2013 9 June 1870) was an English writer and social critic. He created some of the world's best-known fictional characters and is regarded by many as the greatest novelist of the Victorian era. His works enjoyed unprecedented popularity\nthat the Victorian public confronted issues of social justice that had commonly been ignored. It has been argued that his technique of flooding his narratives with an 'unruly superfluity of material' that, in the gradual d\u00e9nouement, yields up an unsuspected order, influenced the organisation of Charles Darwin's \"On the Origin of Species\". Museums and festivals celebrating Dickens's life and works exist in many places with which Dickens was associated. These include the Charles Dickens Museum in London, the historic home where he wrote \"Oliver Twist\", \"The Pickwick Papers\" and \"Nicholas Nickleby\"; and the Charles Dickens Birthplace Museum in Portsmouth, the\nand inspiring a new class of readers. Dickens was regarded as the literary colossus of his age.

        "text": "Naypyidaw Naypyidaw, officially spelled Nay Pyi Taw (; , formerly known as \"Kyetpyay, Pyinmana\" or \"Kyatpyay, Pyinmana\"), is the capital city of Myanmar and seat of the government of Myanmar. It is administered as the Naypyidaw Union Territory, as per the Constitution. It is unusual among Myanmar's cities, being an entirely planned city outside of any state or region, similar to Canberra in Australia, Bras\u00edlia in Brazil, or Washington, D.C. in the United States. As the seat of the government of Myanmar, Naypyidaw is the site of the Union Parliament, the Supreme Court, the Presidential Palace, the official residences of\nthe Cabinet of Myanmar and the headquarters of government ministries and military. Naypyidaw is notable for its unusual combination of large size and very low population density. The city hosted the 24th and 25th ASEAN Summit, the 3rd BIMSTEC Summit, the Ninth East Asia Summit, and the 2013 Southeast Asian Games. \"Naypyidaw\" is Burmese for \"abode of the king\", and is generally translated as \"royal capital\", \"seat of the king\", or \"abode of kings\". Traditionally, it was used as a suffix to the names of royal capitals, such as Mandalay, which was called Yadanabon Naypyidaw (). Naypyidaw has a short\ndid it as a \"vanity project\". Naypyidaw is more centrally located than the old capital, Yangon. It is also a transportation hub located adjacent to the Shan, Kayah, and Kayin states. It was felt by governmental and military leaders that a stronger military and governmental presence nearby might provide stability to those chronically turbulent regions. Climate consideration could have also contributed to the capital transfer, since Yangon proved vulnerable to Cyclone Nargis, which killed over 100,000 people in Myanmar in May 2008. The official explanation for moving the capital was that Yangon had become too congested and crowded with little\nroom for future expansion of government offices. During World War II, Pyinmana township, a part of the current city was the headquarters of Gen Aung San, the Father of the Nation of modern-day Myanmar. Naypyidaw is located between the Bago Yoma and Shan Yoma mountain ranges. The city covers an area of and has a population of 924,608, according to official figures. Chaungmagyi Dam is located a few kilometers to the north of Naypyidaw, while Ngalaik Dam is a few kilometers to the south. The Yezin Dam is farther away in the north-east. Naypyidaw is organized into a number of\nforeign embassies and headquarters of United Nations missions. The Chinese embassy has formally opened its interim liaison office in 2017. The liaison office is the first foreign office to be permitted to open in Naypyidaw. Bangladesh and Malaysia have also signed agreements to open embassies in Naypyidaw. The government confirms that proposals have been put forward by 11 other countries to move their embassies to Naypyidaw, namely Russia, China, the United States, India, Saudi Arabia, Qatar, the Philippines, Indonesia, Thailand, Turkey and Kuwait.

Built of travertine, tuff, and brick-faced concrete, it is the largest amphitheatre ever built. The Colosseum is situated just east of the Roman Forum. Construction began under the emperor Vespasian in AD 72, and was completed in AD 80 under his successor and heir Titus. Further modifications were made during the reign of Domitian (81\u201396).

In antiquity, Romans may have referred to the Colosseum by the unofficial name \"Amphitheatrum Caesareum\" (with \"Caesareum\" an adjective pertaining to the title \"Caesar\"), but this name may have been strictly poetic as it was not exclusive to the Colosseum; Vespasian and Titus, builders of the Colosseum, also constructed an amphitheater of the\nappropriated for his own use.

In 1820, French researchers Pierre Joseph Pelletier and Joseph Bienaim\u00e9 Caventou first isolated quinine from the bark of a tree in the genus \"Cinchona\" - probably \"Cinchona officinalis\" - and subsequently named the substance. The name was derived from the original Quechua (Inca) word for the cinchona tree bark, \"quina\" or \"quina-quina\", which means \"bark of bark\" or \"holy bark\". Prior to 1820, the bark\nthe Quechua, who are indigenous to Peru, Bolivia and Ecuador, to halt shivering due to low temperatures. The Quechuas would mix the ground bark of cinchona trees with sweetened water to offset the bark's bitter taste, thus producing tonic water. The Jesuits were the first to bring cinchona to Europe. The Spanish were aware of the medicinal properties of cinchona bark by the 1570s or earlier: Nicol\u00e1s Monardes (1571) and Juan Fragoso (1572) both described a tree that was subsequently identified as the cinchona tree and whose bark was used to produce a drink to treat diarrhea. Quinine has been\nin quinology to examine the contents of these components in assays. The yields of quinine in the cultivated trees were low and it took a while to develop sustainable methods to extract bark. In the meantime Charles Ledger and his native assistant Manuel collected another species from Bolivia. Manuel was caught and beaten by Bolivian officials leading to his death but Ledger obtained seeds of high quality which were offered to the British who were uninterested, leading to the rest being sold to the Dutch. The Dutch saw its value and multiplied the stock. The species later named as \"Cinchona\nis an ingredient in both tonic water and bitter lemon.

Freemasonry had been condemned by previous popes as being contrary to Catholic doctrine, but according to \"Humanum genus\", the nature of Freemasonry was changing as Freemasons were far more open in society with their practices and affiliations. \"Humanum genus\" specifically condemned certain practices of the Freemasons, including: religious indifference; the promotion of public education that denied the Church's role and where \"the education of youth shall be exclusively\nseen as driving Freemasons headlong toward a fundamental clash with the teachings of the Church, especially in light of Freemasons' support of separation of church and state by their efforts to enact and enforce civil constitutional obstacles to the establishment of state churches. \"Humanum genus\" criticizes a number of other Masonic principles; for example, the idea that popular sovereignty is the source of \"all\" rights and that man should bend to no authority other than himself: Then come their doctrines of politics, in which the naturalists lay down that all men have the same right, and are in every respect\nthat the State should be without God; that in the various forms of religion there is no reason why one should have precedence of another; and that they are all to occupy the same place.

In Ophelia's first speaking appearance in the play, she is seen with her brother, Laertes, who is leaving for France. Laertes warns her that Hamlet, the heir to the throne of Denmark, does not have the freedom to marry\nshe escape. Packer argued that Ophelia's problems stem from being too dutiful a daughter as she obeys her father in rejecting Hamlet and returning his gifts to him, as she is untrue to herself, thus settling herself up for her downfall. Ophelia has been portrayed on screen since the days of early silent films. Dorothy Foster played Ophelia opposite Charles Raymond's Hamlet in the 1912 film \"Hamlet\". Jean Simmons played Ophelia opposite Laurence Olivier's Oscar-winning Hamlet performance in 1948; Simmons was also nominated for the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress. More recently, Ophelia has been portrayed by Anastasiya Vertinskaya\narms one last time and proclaims how much he loved her. Hamlet, nearby, then challenges Laertes and claims that he loved Ophelia more than \"forty thousand\" brothers could. After her funeral scene, Ophelia is no longer mentioned. While it is known that Richard Burbage played Hamlet in Shakespeare's time, there is no evidence of who played Ophelia; since there were no professional actresses on the public stage in Elizabethan England, we may assume that she was played by a boy. The actor appears to have had some musical ability, as Ophelia is given lines from ballads such as \"Walsingham\" to\na friend whom he trusted and she lied to him. After Hamlet storms out, Ophelia makes her \"O, what a noble mind is here o'erthrown\" soliloquy. The next time Ophelia appears is at the \"Mousetrap Play\", which Hamlet has arranged to try to prove that Claudius killed King Hamlet. Hamlet sits with Ophelia and makes sexually suggestive remarks; he also says that woman's love is brief. Later that night, after the play, Hamlet kills Polonius during a private meeting between Hamlet and his mother, Queen Gertrude.

As Six Grandfathers, the mountain was part of the route that Lakota leader Black Elk took in a spiritual journey that culminated at Black Elk Peak.

These presidents were selected by Borglum because of their role in preserving the Republic and expanding its territory.

Arriving in Chicago in 1945, he occasionally found work as a guitarist but garnered more attention for his already highly developed harmonica playing. According to Chicago bluesman Floyd Jones, Little Walter's first recording was an unreleased demo recorded soon after he arrived in Chicago, on which Walter played guitar backing Jones. Jacobs, reportedly frustrated with having his harmonica drowned out by electric guitars, adopted a simple but previously little-used method: He cupped a small microphone in his hands\nalong with his harmonica and plugged the microphone into a public address system or guitar amplifier. He could thus compete with any guitarist's volume. However, unlike other contemporary blues harp players, such as Sonny Boy Williamson I and Snooky Pryor, who like many other harmonica players had also begun using the newly available amplifier technology around the same time solely for added volume, Little Walter purposely pushed his amplifiers beyond their intended technical limitations, using the amplification to explore and develop radical new timbres and sonic effects previously unheard from a harmonica or any other instrument.

Little Walter, Sonny Boy Williamson (Rice Miller) and Sonny Terry are well known harmonica (called \"harp\" by blues musicians) players of the early Chicago blues scene. Other harp players such as Big Walter Horton were also influential. Muddy Waters and Elmore James were known for their innovative use of slide electric guitar. Howlin' Wolf and Muddy Waters were known for their deep, \"gravelly\" voices. The bassist and prolific songwriter and composer Willie Dixon played a major role on the Chicago blues\nthroughout his career and also crossed over to rock audiences while touring with the Rolling Stones. Not long before Wells died, the blues historian Gerard Herzhaft called him \"one of the rare active survivors of the 'golden age of the blues'\". Wells may have been born in Memphis, Tennessee, and raised in West Memphis, Arkansas (some sources report that he was born in West Memphis). Initially taught by his cousin Junior Parker and by Sonny Boy Williamson II, Wells learned to play the harmonica skillfully by the age of seven. He moved to Chicago in 1948 with his mother, after\nseveral occasions in the 1970s. Wells's album \"South Side Blues Jam\" was released in 1971, followed by \"On Tap\" in 1975.

The text is written in an amusing, extravagant, and satirical vein, and features much crudity, scatological humor, and violence (lists of explicit or vulgar insults fill several chapters). The censors of the Coll\u00e8ge de la Sorbonne stigmatized it as obscene, and in a social climate of increasing religious oppression in a lead up to the French Wars of Religion,\nthe allusions and puns used. The most famous and reproduced illustrations for \"Gargantua and Pantagruel\" were done by French artist Gustave Dor\u00e9 and published in 1854. Several appear in this article. Over 400 additional drawings were done by Dor\u00e9 for the 1873 second edition of the book. An edition published in 1904 was illustrated by W. Heath Robinson.

This early \"Gargantua\" text enjoyed great popularity, despite its rather poor construction. Rabelais's giants are not described as being of any fixed height, as in the first two books of \"Gulliver's Travels\", but vary in size from chapter to chapter. For example, in one chapter Pantagruel is able to fit into a courtroom\nof these works were often in prose). Finally, the Italian Luigi Pulci's \"Morgant le g\u00e9ant\", a comic version of the chivalric novel, was an important model for Rabelais's giants. The most notable French novels of the first half of the century are Fran\u00e7ois Rabelais\u2019s masterpieces \"Pantagruel\", \"Gargantua\" and their sequels. Rabelais\u2019s works blend both humanism (Erasmus, Thomas More) and medieval farce (giants, heroic battles, scatological humor) in a manner that is grotesquely extravagant (the language and humor were often viewed as coarse by later centuries), but along with the buffoonery there is a keen satire of religious hypocrisy, political injustice\nafter his death and includes much material that is clearly borrowed (such as from Lucian's \"True History\" and Francesco Colonna's \"Hypnerotomachia Poliphili\") or of lesser quality than the previous books. In the notes to his translation of \"Gargantua and Pantagruel\", Donald M. Frame proposes that the Fifth Book may have been formed from unfinished material that a publisher later patched together. This interpretation has been largely supported by Mireille Huchon in \"Rabelais Grammairien\", the first book to provide a rigorous grammatical analysis of the matter. J. M.

Electromagnetic waves are typically described by any of the following three physical properties: the frequency \"f\", wavelength \u03bb, or photon energy \"E\".

Wavelength is inversely proportional to the wave frequency, so gamma rays have very short wavelengths that are fractions of the size of atoms, whereas wavelengths on the\nX-ray X-rays make up X-radiation, a form of electromagnetic radiation. Most X-rays have a wavelength ranging from 0.01 to 10 nanometers, corresponding to frequencies in the range 30 petahertz to 30 exahertz (3\u00d710 Hz to 3\u00d710 Hz) and energies in the range 100 eV to 100 keV. X-ray wavelengths are shorter than those of UV rays and typically longer than those of gamma rays.

There is no consensus for a definition distinguishing between X-rays and gamma rays. One common practice is to distinguish between the two types of radiation based on their source: X-rays are emitted by electrons, while gamma rays are emitted by the atomic nucleus. This definition has several problems: other processes also can generate these high-energy photons, or sometimes the method of generation is not known. One common alternative is to distinguish X- and gamma radiation on the basis of wavelength (or, equivalently, frequency or photon energy), with radiation shorter than some arbitrary wavelength, such as 10 m\nthe absorbed dose. X-ray X-rays make up X-radiation, a form of electromagnetic radiation. Most X-rays have a wavelength ranging from 0.01 to 10 nanometers, corresponding to frequencies in the range 30 petahertz to 30 exahertz (3\u00d710 Hz to 3\u00d710 Hz) and energies in the range 100 eV to 100 keV.

The electromagnetic waves in each of these bands have different characteristics, such as how they are produced, how they interact with matter, and their practical applications. The limit for long wavelengths is the size of the universe itself, while it is thought that the short wavelength limit is in the vicinity of the Planck length. Gamma rays, X-rays, and high ultraviolet are classified as \"ionizing radiation\" as their photons have enough energy to ionize atoms, causing chemical reactions.

The Dutch composer Louis Andriessen commented that: \"Andrew Lloyd Webber has yet to think up a single note; in fact, the poor guy's never invented one note by himself. That's rather poor\". Lloyd Webber's biographer, John Snelson,\ncommissioned Lloyd Webber and Rice to write a piece for the school's choir. Doggett requested a \"pop cantata\" along the lines of Herbert Chappell's \"The Daniel Jazz\" (1963) and Michael Hurd's \"Jonah-Man Jazz\" (1966), both of which had been published by Novello and were based on the Old Testament. The request for the new piece came with a 100-guinea advance from Novello. This resulted in \"Joseph and the Amazing Technicolor Dreamcoat\", a retelling of the biblical story of Joseph, in which Lloyd Webber and Rice humorously pastiched a number of pop-music styles such as Elvis-style rock'n'roll, Calypso and country music.",

        "text": "The Song of Hiawatha The Song of Hiawatha is an 1855 epic poem in trochaic tetrameter by Henry Wadsworth Longfellow that features Native American characters. The epic relates the fictional adventures of an Ojibwe warrior named Hiawatha and the tragedy of his love for Minnehaha, a Dakota woman. Events in the story are set in the Pictured Rocks area on the south shore of Lake Superior. Longfellow's poem, though based on native oral traditions surrounding the figure of Manabozho, represents not a work of transmission but an original work of American Romantic literature. Longfellow's sources for the legends and ethnography\nbetween the original stories, as \"reshaped by Schoolcraft,\" and the episodes in the poem are but superficial, and Longfellow omits important details essential to Ojibwe narrative construction, characterization, and theme. This is the case even with \"Hiawatha\u2019s Fishing,\" the episode closest to its source. Some important parts of the poem were more or less Longfellow's invention from fragments or his imagination. \"The courtship of Hiawatha and Minnehaha, the least 'Indian' of any of the events in \"Hiawatha\", has come for many readers to stand as the typical American Indian tale.\" Also, \"in exercising the function of selecting incidents to make\nverse\" for every detail Longfellow took from Schoolcraft. Others have identified words from native languages included in the poem. Intentionally epic in scope, \"The Song of Hiawatha\" was described by its author as \"this Indian Edda\". But Thompson judged that despite Longfellow's claimed \"chapter and verse\" citations, the work \"produce[s] a unity the original will not warrant,\" i.e., it is non-Indian in its totality. Thompson found close parallels in plot between the poem and its sources, with the major exception that Longfellow took legends told about multiple characters and substituted the character Hiawatha as the protagonist of them all. Resemblances\nof Longfellow's poem nevertheless led to the name \"Hiawatha\" becoming attached to a number of locales and enterprises in areas more historically associated with the Ojibwe than the Iroquois. The poem was published on November 10, 1855, by Ticknor and Fields and was an immediate success. In 1857, Longfellow calculated that it had sold 50,000 copies. Longfellow chose to set \"The Song of Hiawatha\" at the Pictured Rocks, one of the locations along the south shore of Lake Superior favored by narrators of the Manabozho stories. The \"Song\" presents a legend of Hiawatha and his lover \"Minnehaha\" in 22 chapters\nMuch later, Mary Montgomery Koppel (b.1982) incorporated Ojibwe flute music for her setting of \"The death of Minnehaha\" (2013) for two voices with piano and flute accompaniment. The most celebrated setting of Longfellow's story was the cantata trilogy, \"The Song of Hiawatha\" (1898\u20131900), by the Sierra Leone-English composer Samuel Coleridge-Taylor. The first part, \"Hiawatha's Wedding Feast\" (Op. 30, No. 1), based on cantos 11\u201312 of the poem, was particularly famous for well over 50 years, receiving thousands of performances in the UK, the USA, Canada, New Zealand and South Africa.

Guru Nanak's words are registered\nthe form of 974 poetic hymns in the holy text of Sikhism, the Guru Granth Sahib, with some of the major prayers being the Japji Sahib, the Asa di Var and the Sidh-Ghost. It is part of Sikh religious belief that the spirit of Guru Nanak's sanctity, divinity and religious authority descended upon each of the nine subsequent Gurus when the Guruship was devolved on to them.

As the first guru of Sikhism, Guru Nanak contributed a total of 974 hymns to the book.

Daedalus's parentage was supplied as a later addition, providing him with a father in Metion, Eupalamus, or Palamaon, and a mother, Alcippe, Iphinoe, or Phrasmede.

Many bridges and culverts designed to let water and wildlife pass underneath and permit the natural water flow of the Everglades were built as part of the upgrade. This\nhighway before it was converted to a four-lane highway meeting Interstate Highway standards.

Critic Roger Ebert called it a very good movie, but credited Nicholson's acting as the main reason: \"He creates a character so complete and so complex that we stop thinking about the movie and just watch to see what he'll do next.\" In 1974, Nicholson starred in Roman Polanski's noir thriller, \"Chinatown\", and was again nominated for Academy Award for Best Actor for his role as Jake Gittes, a private detective.\nThe film co-starred Faye Dunaway and John Huston, and included a cameo role with Polanski. Roger Ebert described Nicholson's portrayal as sharp-edged, menacing, and aggressive, a character who knew \"how to go over the top\", as he did in \"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest\". It is that edge that kept \"Chinatown\" from becoming a typical genre crime film. Ebert also notes the importance of the role for Nicholson's career, seeing it as a major transition from the exploitation films of the previous decade. \"As Jake Gittes, he stepped into Bogart's shoes\", says Ebert. \"As a man attractive to audiences\nhandle the role, saying, \"There is James Cagney, Spencer Tracy, Humphrey Bogart, and Henry Fonda. After that, who is there but Jack Nicholson?\" During the filming, Nicholson struck up what became a lifelong friendship with co-star Garfunkel. When he visited Los Angeles, Garfunkel would stay at Nicholson's home in a room Nicholson jokingly called \"the Arthur Garfunkel Suite\".

The observatory was established in 1945 by Bernard Lovell, a radio astronomer at the University of Manchester to investigate cosmic rays after his work on radar during the Second World War. It has since played an important role in the research of meteors, quasars, pulsars, masers and gravitational lenses, and was heavily involved with the\ntracking of space probes at the start of the Space Age. The managing director of the observatory is Professor Simon Garrington. The main telescope at the observatory is the Lovell Telescope, which is the third largest steerable radio telescope in the world. There are three other active telescopes at the observatory; the Mark II, and and 7 m diameter radio telescopes.

He is credited with single-handedly inventing the turbojet engine. A patent was submitted by Maxime Guillaume in 1921 for a similar invention; however, this was technically unfeasible at the time. Whittle's jet engines were developed some years earlier than those of Germany's Hans von Ohain who was the designer of the first \"operational\" turbojet engine. From an early age, Whittle demonstrated an aptitude for engineering and an interest in flying. At first he was turned down by the\nthe fighter to arrive too late to improve Germany's position in World War II, however this was the first jet engine to be used in service. Meanwhile, in Britain the Gloster E28/39 had its maiden flight on 15 May 1941 and the Gloster Meteor finally entered service with the RAF in July 1944. These were powered by turbojet engines from Power Jets Ltd., set up by Frank Whittle. The first two operational turbojet aircraft, the Messerschmitt Me 262 and then the Gloster Meteor entered service within three months of each other in 1944. Following the end of the war the\nGerman jet aircraft and jet engines were extensively studied by the victorious allies and contributed to work on early Soviet and US jet fighters. The legacy of the axial-flow engine is seen in the fact that practically all jet engines on fixed-wing aircraft have had some inspiration from this design. By the 1950s the jet engine was almost universal in combat aircraft, with the exception of cargo, liaison and other specialty types. By this point some of the British designs were already cleared for civilian use, and had appeared on early models like the de Havilland Comet and Avro Canada\ntaking out a patent on his design in 1930. His performance on an officers' engineering course earned him a place on a further course at Peterhouse, Cambridge, where he graduated with a First. Without Air Ministry support, he and two retired RAF servicemen formed Power Jets Ltd to build his engine with assistance from the firm of British Thomson-Houston.

It was the first of Berlioz's operas, premiered at the Acad\u00e9mie Royale de Musique (Salle Le Peletier) on 10 September 1838. The story is inspired by the memoirs of the Florentine sculptor Benvenuto Cellini, although the elements of the plot are largely fictional. The opera is technically very challenging and rarely performed. However, the overture to the opera sometimes features in symphony orchestra programs, as does the concert overture \"Le carnaval romain\" which\nand with Jon Vickers in the title role. The first performance of the work at the Metropolitan Opera took place on 4 December 2003, with James Levine conducting, Andrei \u0218erban stage directing, and Marcello Giordani singing the title role. In 2007 \"Benvenuto Cellini\" was staged at Salzburg Festival conducted by Valery Gergiev. A new production directed by Terry Gilliam, with the libretto in an English translation by Charles Hart, was premiered by the English National Opera on 5 June 2014.

At its premiere, the audience hissed most of the music after the first few numbers. In 1851, Franz Liszt offered to revive the opera in a new production (and version) in Weimar, and suggested changes to the score to Berlioz. This version was performed in Weimar in 1852, where the title role was sung by Karl Beck, the same tenor who had created Wagner's Lohengrin in 1850, also under Liszt, and\ncrucible and melted, to the consternation of Francesco and Bernardino. After this is done, an explosion blows the lid off the crucible. Then molten metal emerges to fill the mould, and the casting is successful. Balducci and Fieramosca acknowledge Cellini's success.

In 2015, Robert McCrum released his selection list of 100 best novels of all time in which \"Gulliver\u2019s Travels\", a satirical masterpiece, is listed. The travel begins with a short preamble in which Lemuel Gulliver gives a brief outline of his life and history before his voyages. During his first voyage, Gulliver is washed ashore after a shipwreck and finds himself a prisoner of a race of tiny people, less than tall, who are inhabitants of the island country of Lilliput.

        "text": "fellow Florentine and client of the Medici, Leonardo da Vinci.<ref name=\"Britannica\"/ A number of Michelangelo's works of painting, sculpture and architecture rank among the most famous in existence. His output in these fields was prodigious; given the sheer volume of surviving correspondence, sketches and reminiscences, he is the best-documented artist of the 16th century. He sculpted two of his best-known works, the \"Piet\u00e0\" and \"David\", before the age of thirty. Despite holding a low opinion of painting, he also created two of the most influential frescoes in the history of Western art: the scenes from Genesis on the ceiling of\nthe Virgin Mary grieving over the body of Jesus. The subject, which is not part of the Biblical narrative of the Crucifixion, was common in religious sculpture of Medieval Northern Europe and would have been very familiar to the Cardinal. The contract was agreed upon in August of the following year. Michelangelo was 24 at the time of its completion. It was soon to be regarded as one of the world's great masterpieces of sculpture, \"a revelation of all the potentialities and force of the art of sculpture\". Contemporary opinion was summarised by Vasari: \"It is certainly a miracle that\nFlorentine freedom to be placed on the gable of Florence Cathedral. Michelangelo responded by completing his most famous work, the statue of David, in 1504. The masterwork definitively established his prominence as a sculptor of extraordinary technical skill and strength of symbolic imagination. A team of consultants, including Botticelli and Leonardo da Vinci, was called together to decide upon its placement, ultimately the Piazza della Signoria, in front of the Palazzo Vecchio. It now stands in the Academia while a replica occupies its place in the square. With the completion of the \"David\" came another commission. In early 1504 Leonardo\nMichelangelo Michelangelo di Lodovico Buonarroti Simoni or more commonly known by his first name Michelangelo (; ; 6 March 1475 \u2013 18 February 1564) was an Italian sculptor, painter, architect and poet of the High Renaissance born in the Republic of Florence, who exerted an unparalleled influence on the development of Western art. Considered by many the greatest artist of his lifetime, and by some the greatest artist of all time, his artistic versatility was of such a high order that he is often considered a contender for the title of the archetypal Renaissance man, along with his rival, the\nimpact on the course of art.

In 1934, Walt Disney gathered several key staff members and announced his plans to make his first feature animated film. Despite derision from most of the film industry, who dubbed the production \"Disney's Folly,\" Disney proceeded undaunted into the production of \"Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs\", which would become the first animated feature in English and Technicolor. Considerable training and development went into the production of \"Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs\", and the studio greatly expanded with established animators, artists from other\nanimators, with storyboard artists who would detail the plots of Disney's films. By 1934, Disney had become dissatisfied with producing formulaic cartoon shorts, and began a four-year production of a feature-length cartoon, \"Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs\", based on the fairy tale. When news leaked out about the project, many in the film industry predicted it would bankrupt the company; industry insiders nicknamed it \"Disney's Folly\". The film, which was the first animated feature made in full color and sound, cost $1.5 million to producethree times over budget.

By the mid-1950s, with Walt Disney's attention primarily set on new endeavours such as live-action films, television, and the Disneyland theme park, production of the animated films was left primarily in the hands of the \"Nine Old Men\" trust of head animators and directors.

In addition, Disney began reissuing the previous features, beginning with re-releases of \"Snow White\" in 1944, \"Pinocchio\" in 1945, and \"Fantasia\" in 1946. This led to a tradition of reissuing the Disney films every seven years, which lasted into the 1990s before being translated into the studio's handling of home video releases.

Matthew Grenby, author of \"Children's Literature\", states that the five were involved with \"unmasking hardened villains and solving serious crimes\", although the novels were \"hardly 'hard-boiled' thrillers\". Blyton based the character of Georgina, a tomboy she described as\nof Mary Pollock (middle name plus first married name), in addition to the eleven published under her own name that year. So popular were Pollock's books that one reviewer was prompted to observe that \"Enid Blyton had better look to her laurels\".

As of 15 May 2018, Queensland has a population\nof 5,000,000, concentrated along the coast and particularly in the state's South East. The capital and largest city in the state is Brisbane, Australia's third-largest city. Often referred to as the \"Sunshine State\", Queensland is home to 10 of Australia's 30 largest cities and is the nation's third-largest economy. Tourism in the state, fuelled largely by its warm tropical climate, is a major industry. Queensland was first inhabited by Aboriginal Australians and Torres Strait Islanders. The first European to land in Queensland (and Australia) was Dutch navigator Willem Janszoon in 1606, who explored the west coast of the Cape York\nSouth Australian border. The state capital is Brisbane, a coastal city 100 kilometres (60 mi) by road north of the New South Wales border. The state is divided into several officially recognised regions. Other smaller geographical regions of note include the Atherton Tablelands, the Granite Belt, and the Channel Country in the far southwest. Queensland has many areas of natural beauty, including the Sunshine Coast and the Gold Coast, home to some of the state's most popular beaches; the Bunya Mountains and the Great Dividing Range, with numerous lookouts, waterfalls and picnic areas; Carnarvon Gorge; Whitsunday Islands; and Hinchinbrook Island.\nit is one of Australia's economic powerhouses and the third-most populous state in the country.

Besides the Connelly series, Harry Bosch has made cameos in several other authors' books. Bosch has appeared in books by Paula Woods, Joe Gores, and Robert Crais. Likewise, during an October 16, 2008 book-signing in San Mateo, California, to promote \"The Brass Verdict\", Michael Connelly informed the audience that Bosch also appeared in a cameo without identification in Connelly's novel \"Chasing the Dime\".

Reserves of ytterbium are estimated as one million tonnes. Ytterbium is normally difficult to separate from other rare earths, but ion-exchange and solvent extraction techniques developed in the mid- to late 20th century have simplified separation. Compounds of ytterbium are rare and have not yet been well characterized. The abundance of ytterbium in the Earth's crust is about 3 mg/kg.

Marignac suspected that ytterbia was a compound of a new element that he called \"ytterbium\". In 1907, the French chemist Georges Urbain separated Marignac's ytterbia into two components: neoytterbia and lutecia. Neoytterbia later became known as the element ytterbium, and lutecia became known as the element lutetium. The Austrian chemist Carl Auer von Welsbach independently isolated these elements from ytterbia at about the same time, but he called them aldebaranium and cassiopeium; the American chemist Charles James also independently isolated these elements at about the same\nYtterbium Ytterbium is a chemical element with symbol Yb and atomic number 70. It is the fourteenth and penultimate element in the lanthanide series, which is the basis of the relative stability of its +2 oxidation state. However, like the other lanthanides, its most common oxidation state is +3, as in its oxide, halides, and other compounds. In aqueous solution, like compounds of other late lanthanides, soluble ytterbium compounds form complexes with nine water molecules.

        "question": "Who is the author of the story that created the character referenced in Jack L. Warner's autobiography?",
        "text": "Walter Mitty Walter Mitty is a fictional character in James Thurber's short story \"The Secret Life of Walter Mitty\", first published in \"The New Yorker\" on March 18, 1939, and in book form in \"My World and Welcome to It\" in 1942. Thurber loosely based the character, a daydreamer, on his friend Walter Mithoff. It was made into a film in 1947 starring Danny Kaye, with a remake directed by and starring Ben Stiller released in 2013. Mitty is a meek, mild man with a vivid fantasy life. In a few dozen paragraphs he imagines himself a wartime pilot, an\nineffectual dreamer and appears in several dictionaries. \"The American Heritage Dictionary\" defines a Walter Mitty as \"an ordinary often ineffectual person who indulges in fantastic daydreams of personal triumphs\". The most famous of Thurber's inept male protagonists, the character is considered \"the archetype for dreamy, hapless, Thurber Man\". When referencing actor Errol Flynn, Warner Brothers studio head, Jack L. Warner, noted in his autobiography, \"My First Hundred Years in Hollywood\", \"To the Walter Mittys of the world he [Flynn] was all the heroes in one magnificent, sexy, animal package\". In his 1992 biography of Henry Kissinger, Walter Isaacson records that\nofficer. In his book on selection for the Special Air Service, Andy McNab wrote that soldiers from other units who were applying to join, who give away the fact they were motivated by reasons of personal vanity were labelled as \"Walter Mitties\" and quietly sent home. The character was first played by Danny Kaye in the 1947 film version. Thurber opposed this 1947 production. Ben Stiller directed and starred in a 2013 adaptation of the Walter Mitty story. Walter Mitty is referenced in the lyrics of these songs: Walter Mitty Walter Mitty is a fictional character in James Thurber's short\nemergency-room surgeon, and a devil-may-care killer. Although the story has humorous elements, there is a darker and more significant message underlying the text, leading to a more tragic interpretation of the Mitty character. Even in his heroic daydreams, Mitty does not triumph, several fantasies being interrupted before the final one sees Mitty dying bravely in front of a firing squad. In the brief snatches of reality that punctuate Mitty's fantasies the audience meets well-meaning but insensitive strangers who inadvertently rob Mitty of some of his remaining dignity. The character's name has come into more general use to refer to an\nuse of the services of military psychiatrists were \"Walter Mitty\" characters who fabricated or exaggerated their experience. Terry Gilliam described his film \"Brazil\" as \"Walter Mitty Meets Franz Kafka\". Individuals who impersonate serving or retired members of the armed forces are known as \"Walts\" in the British Armed Forces, a shortened form of the name \"Walter Mitty\". In the United Kingdom it is an offence under the Armed Forces Act 2006 to wear real or replica military decorations with intent to deceive. Such an example of this is Alan Mcilwraith, who falsely claimed to be a highly decorated British Army",

Between 1793 and 1814 Monaco was occupied by the French (in this period much of Europe had been overrun by the French under command of Napoleon). The principality was reestablished in 1814 only to be designated a protectorate of the Kingdom of Sardinia by the Congress of Vienna in 1815. Monaco remained in this position until 1860 when, by the Treaty of Turin, the Sardinian forces pulled out of the principality and the surrounding county\nrulers of \"the Rock of Monaco\". In 1612 Honor\u00e9 II began to style himself \"Prince\" of Monaco. In the 1630s, he sought French protection against the Spanish forces and, in 1642, was received at the court of Louis XIII \"Duc et Pair Etranger\". The princes of Monaco thus became vassals of the French kings while at the same time remaining sovereign princes.

        "text": "Castor and Pollux Castor and Pollux (or in Greek, Polydeuces) were twin half-brothers in Greek and Roman mythology, known together as the Dioscuri. Their mother was Leda, but they had different fathers; Castor was the mortal son of Tyndareus, the king of Sparta, while Pollux was the divine son of Zeus, who seduced Leda in the guise of a swan. Though accounts of their birth are varied, they are sometimes said to have been born from an egg, along with their twin sisters Helen of Troy and Clytemnestra. In Latin the twins are also known as the Gemini (literally \"twins\")\nfrom Sparta, at a shrine known as the \"Menel\u00e1eion\" where Helen, Menelaus, Castor and Pollux were all said to be buried. Castor himself was also venerated in the region of Kastoria in northern Greece. They were commemorated both as gods on Olympus worthy of holocaust, and as deceased mortals in Hades, whose spirits had to be propitiated by libations. Lesser shrines to Castor, Pollux and Helen were also established at a number of other locations around Sparta. The pear tree was regarded by the Spartans as sacred to Castor and Pollux, and images of the twins were hung in its\nintervention of the Twins. The Roman legend may in fact have had its origins in the Locrian account and possibly supplies further evidence of cultural transmission between Rome and Magna Graecia. The Romans believed that the twins aided them on the battlefield. Their role as horsemen made them particularly attractive to the Roman \"equites\" and cavalry. Each year on July 15, the feast day of the Dioskouroi, the 1,800 equestrians would parade through the streets of Rome in an elaborate spectacle in which each rider wore full military attire and whatever decorations he had earned. Castor and Pollux are also\na blow from his spear\u2014but not before Castor called out to warn Pollux. In the ensuing brawl, Pollux killed Lynceus. As Idas was about to kill Pollux, Zeus, who had been watching from Mt. Olympus, hurled a thunderbolt, killing Idas and saving his son. Returning to the dying Castor, Pollux was given the choice by Zeus of spending all his time on Mount Olympus or giving half his immortality to his mortal brother. He opted for the latter, enabling the twins to alternate between Olympus and Hades. The brothers became the two brightest stars in the constellation Gemini (\"the twins\"):\nof Tyndareus alone, but they were sons of Zeus in the Hesiodic \"Catalogue\" (fr. 24 M-W). The conventional account (attested first in Pindar, Nemean 10) combined these paternities so that only Pollux was fathered by Zeus, while Leda and her husband Tyndareus conceived Castor. This explains why they were granted an alternate immortality. It is a common belief that one would live among the gods, while the other was among the dead.

The shorts from this era can be identified by their different title sequence, featuring stylized limited animation and graphics on a black background and a new arrangement, by William Lava, of \"The Merry-Go-Round Broke Down\". The change in the introductory title cards was possibly to reflect the switch in the animation style of the shorts themselves. The original \"Looney Tunes\" theatrical series ran from 1930 to 1969 (the last short being \"Bugged by a Bee\", by Robert McKimson). The \"Looney Tunes\" series' popularity was strengthened even more when the shorts began airing on\nthe \"Blue Ribbon Classics\" series of \"Merrie Melodies\".

Athena was regarded as the patron and protectress of various cities across Greece, particularly the city of Athens, from which she most likely received her name. She is usually shown in art wearing a helmet and holding a spear. Her major symbols include owls, olive trees, snakes, and the Gorgoneion. From her origin as an Aegean palace goddess, Athena was closely associated with the city.

She plays an active role in the \"Iliad\", in which she assists the Achaeans and, in the \"Odyssey\", she is the divine counselor to Odysseus. In the later writings of the Roman poet Ovid, Athena was said to have competed against the mortal Arachne in a weaving competition, afterwards transforming Arachne into the first spider; Ovid also describes how she transformed Medusa into a Gorgon after witnessing her being raped by Poseidon in her temple. Since the Renaissance, Athena has become an\nwarrior-goddess with her \"palladion\", or her palladion in an aniconic representation. In the \"Procession Fresco\" at Knossos, which was reconstructed by the Mycenaeans, two rows of figures carrying vessels seem to meet in front of a central figure, which is probably the Minoan precursor to Athena. The early twentieth-century scholar Martin Persson Nilsson argued that the Minoan snake goddess figurines are early representations of Athena.

However,\nbeing more in keeping with Puccini's evolving technique. See also List of operas by Franco Alfano. Operas Other compositions Notes Franco Alfano Franco Alfano (8 March 1875 in Posillipo, Naples \u2013 27 October 1954 in Sanremo) was an Italian composer and pianist, best known today for his opera \"Risurrezione\" (1904) and above all for having completed Puccini's opera \"Turandot\" in 1926. He had considerable success with several of his own works during his lifetime. Alfano was born in Posillipo, Naples. He attended piano lessons given privately by Alessandro Longo, and harmony and composition respectively under Camillo de Nardis (1857\u20131951) and\nPuccini. He left behind 36 pages of sketches on 23 sheets for the end of \"Turandot\". Some sketches were in the form of \"piano-vocal\" or \"short score,\" including vocal lines with \"two to four staves of accompaniment with occasional notes on orchestration.\" These sketches supplied music for some, but not all, of the final portion of the libretto. Puccini left instructions that Riccardo Zandonai should finish the opera. Puccini's son Tonio objected, and eventually Franco Alfano was chosen to flesh out the sketches after Vincenzo Tommasini (who had completed Boito's \"Nerone\" after the composer's death) and Pietro Mascagni were rejected.\nthe top ten works performed, and Puccini ranks third (behind Verdi and Mozart) in the number of performances of his operas over all. Gustav Kobb\u00e9, the original author of \"The Complete Opera Book\", a standard reference work on opera, wrote in the 1919 edition: \"Puccini is considered the most important figure in operatic Italy today, the successor of Verdi, if there is any.\" Other contemporaries shared this view. Italian opera composers of the generation with whom Puccini was compared included Pietro Mascagni (1863\u20131945), Ruggero Leoncavallo (1857\u20131919), Umberto Giordano (1867\u20131948), Francesco Cilea (1866\u20131950), Baron Pierantonio Tasca (1858\u20131934), Gaetano Coronaro (1852\u20131908), and\nBecause only three \"verismo\" works by Puccini continue to appear regularly on stage (the aforementioned \"Cavalleria rusticana\", \"Pagliacci\", and \"Andrea Ch\u00e9nier\"), Puccini's contribution has had lasting significance to the genre. Both during his lifetime and in posterity, Puccini's success outstripped other Italian opera composers of his time, and he has been matched in this regard by only a handful of composers in the entire history of opera. Eleven of Puccini's operas are numbered among the 200 most-performed operas (worldwide, by composers of any nationality, as surveyed by Operabase).

The earliest recorded form of Horus is the tutelary deity of Nekhen in Upper Egypt, who is the first known national god, specifically related to the ruling pharaoh who in time came to be regarded as a manifestation of Horus in life and Osiris in death. The most commonly encountered family relationship describes Horus as the son of Isis and Osiris, and he plays a key role in the Osiris myth as Osiris's heir and the rival to Set, the murderer of Osiris. In another tradition Hathor is\nand Harsiese \"Horus, Son of Isis\". Nekheny may have been another falcon god worshipped at Nekhen, city of the falcon, with whom Horus was identified from early on. Horus may be shown as a falcon on the Narmer Palette, dating from about the 31st century BC. In early Egypt, Horus was the brother of Isis, Osiris, Set and Nephthys. As different cults formed, he became the son of Isis and Osiris. Isis remained the sister of Osiris, Set and Nephthys. The \"Pyramid Texts\" (c. 2400\u20132300 BC) describe the nature of the pharaoh in different characters as both Horus and Osiris.\nHorus Horus is one of the most significant ancient Egyptian deities. He was worshipped from at least the late prehistoric Egypt until the Ptolemaic Kingdom and Roman Egypt. Different forms of Horus are recorded in history and these are treated as distinct gods by Egyptologists. These various forms may possibly be different manifestations of the same multi-layered deity in which certain attributes or syncretic relationships are emphasized, not necessarily in opposition but complementary to one another, consistent with how the Ancient Egyptians viewed the multiple facets of reality. He was most often depicted as a falcon, most likely a lanner\nform, he was represented as the god of light and the husband of Hathor. He was one of the oldest gods of ancient Egypt. He became the patron of Nekhen (Hierakonpolis) and the first national god ('God of the Kingdom'). Later, he also became the patron of the pharaohs, and was called the son of truth \u2013 signifying his role as an important upholder of Maat. He was seen as a great falcon with outstretched wings whose right eye was the sun and the left one was the moon. In this form, he was sometimes given the title Kemwer, meaning\nregarded as his mother and sometimes as his wife. Horus served many functions, most notably being a god of kingship and the sky. Horus is recorded in Egyptian hieroglyphs as \"\u1e25r.w\" \"Falcon\"; the pronunciation has been reconstructed as . Additional meanings are thought to have been \"the distant one\" or \"one who is above, over\". As the language changed over time, it appeared in Coptic varieties variously as or and was adopted into ancient Greek as \"H\u014dros\" (pronounced at the time as ). It also survives in Late Egyptian and Coptic theophoric name forms such as Siese \"son of Isis\"",

It premiered on 28 July 1824 at the Teatro Nuovo in Naples. The libretto had a complex history.

The critical reaction in the \"Giornali\" some months later focused on the weaknesses of the \"semiseria\" genre itself,\nalthough it did describe Donizetti's music for \"Emilia\" as \"pretty\". The composer's activities in Naples became limited because 1825 was a Holy Year in Rome and the death of Ferdinand I in Naples caused little or no opera to be produced in either city for a considerable time. However, he did obtain a year-long position for the 1825/26 season at the Teatro Carolino in Palermo, where he became musical director (as well teaching at the Conservatory).

The North Island is the 14th largest island in the world and is less mountainous but is marked by volcanism. The highly active Taupo Volcanic Zone has formed a large volcanic plateau, punctuated by the North Island's highest mountain, Mount Ruapehu\ntopography and its sharp mountain peaks, such as the Southern Alps, owe much to the tectonic uplift of land and volcanic eruptions. New Zealand's capital city is Wellington, while its most populous city is Auckland. Sometime between 1250 and 1300, Polynesians settled in the islands that later were named New Zealand and developed a distinctive M\u0101ori culture. In 1642, Dutch explorer Abel Tasman became the first European to sight New Zealand. In 1840, representatives of the United Kingdom and M\u0101ori chiefs signed the Treaty of Waitangi, which declared British sovereignty over the islands. In 1841, New Zealand became a colony\n(). The plateau also hosts the country's largest lake, Lake Taupo, nestled in the caldera of one of the world's most active supervolcanoes. The country owes its varied topography, and perhaps even its emergence above the waves, to the dynamic boundary it straddles between the Pacific and Indo-Australian Plates. New Zealand is part of Zealandia, a microcontinent nearly half the size of Australia that gradually submerged after breaking away from the Gondwanan supercontinent. About 25 million years ago, a shift in plate tectonic movements began to contort and crumple the region. This is now most evident in the Southern Alps,\nNew Zealand New Zealand ( ) is a sovereign island country in the southwestern Pacific Ocean. The country geographically comprises two main landmasses\u2014the North Island (\"Te Ika-a-M\u0101ui\"), and the South Island (\"Te Waipounamu\")\u2014and around 600 smaller islands. New Zealand is situated some east of Australia across the Tasman Sea and roughly south of the Pacific island areas of New Caledonia, Fiji, and Tonga. Because of its remoteness, it was one of the last lands to be settled by humans. During its long period of isolation, New Zealand developed a distinct biodiversity of animal, fungal, and plant life. The country's varied\nthis was the accepted norm. The New Zealand Geographic Board discovered in 2009 that the names of the North Island and South Island had never been formalised, and names and alternative names were formalised in 2013. This set the names as North Island or Te Ika-a-M\u0101ui, and South Island or Te Waipounamu. For each island, either its English or M\u0101ori name can be used, or both can be used together. New Zealand was one of the last major landmasses settled by humans. Radiocarbon dating, evidence of deforestation and mitochondrial DNA variability within M\u0101ori populations suggest New Zealand was first settled",

Studies have shown that ear bones in mammal embryos are attached to the dentary, which is part of the jaw. These are ossified portions of cartilage\u2014called Meckel's cartilage\u2014that are attached to the jaw. As the embryo develops, the cartilage hardens to form bone. Later in development, the bone structure breaks loose from the jaw and migrates to the inner ear area. The structure is known as the middle ear, and is made up of the stapes, incus, malleus, and tympanic membrane. These\ncrus attaches to the posterior ligament of the incus. The long crus articulates with the stapes at the lenticular process. The superior ligament of the incus attaches at the body of the incus to the roof of the tympanic cavity. Vibrations in the middle ear are received via the tympanic membrane. The malleus, resting on the membrane, conveys vibrations to the incus. This in turn conveys vibrations to the stapes. \"Incus\" means \"anvil\" in Latin. Several sources attribute the discovery of the incus to the anatomist and philosopher Alessandro Achillini. The first brief written description of the \"incus\" was by\nOssicles The ossicles (also called auditory ossicles) are three bones in either middle ear that are among the smallest bones in the human body.

Later, he presented \"Frank Sidebottom's Proper Telly Show in B/W\" for the Manchester-based television station Channel M. Throughout his career, Sidebottom made appearances on radio stations such as Manchester's Piccadilly Radio\nand on BBC Radio 1 and BBC Radio 5, alongside Mark and Lard. Sievey grew up in Ashton-on-Mersey, Sale, Cheshire (2.5 miles from Timperley, the town with which Frank Sidebottom would be associated). In 1971 he decided on a career in music and hitch-hiked to London with his brother, staging a sit-in at the Apple Records HQ, demanding to see one of The Beatles. When they were asked to leave they insisted on recording something, and were booked into the studio after playing a song to head of A&R Tony King. Sievey subsequently recorded several demos, which he sent to\nhis band The Freshies and his creation of the Frank Sidebottom character. It is expected to feature interviews with many of Chris Sievey's family and colleagues and exclusive access to Chris' own personal archive of home movies, diaries, notebooks, props and costumes. Jon Ronson, who worked with Sievey, published \"\" in 2014, a memoir of his time in the Frank Sidebottom Oh Blimey Big Band. A biography of Chris Sievey was written by Manchester author Mick Middles, and was published in November 2014. Chris Sievey Christopher Mark Sievey (25 August 1955 \u2013 21 June 2010) was an English musician and\nrecord companies, receiving many rejection letters which he later compiled into a book. Unable to get a deal, he set up his own Razz label in 1974. Sievey released two cassettes under his own name in 1975 and 1976 \u2013 \"Girl in My Blue Jeans\" and \"All Sleeps Secrets\". He then began working under the name The Freshies, with various other musicians involved including Martin Jackson, Billy Duffy and former Nosebleeds bassist Rick Sarko. A string of singles and several cassettes were released between 1978 and 1983, most credited to The Freshies but \"Baiser\" (1979) credited to Chris Sievey, and\nenigmatic Frank (Michael Fassbender). The film was written by Jon Ronson and Peter Straughan, and was based on Ronson's experiences playing in Sievey's Oh Blimey Big Band. Although drawing from Ronson's memoir, the story is set in contemporary Ireland and America, and the Frank character combines elements of Sievey with Daniel Johnston and Captain Beefheart. A feature-length documentary about the life and art of Chris Sievey, entitled \"Being Frank: The Chris Sievey Story\" was announced for release in 2014.

        "text": ". The only part of the stone in contact with the ice is the \"running surface\", a narrow, flat annulus or ring, wide and about in diameter; the sides of the stone bulge convex down to the ring and the inside of the ring is hollowed concave to clear the ice. This concave bottom was first proposed by J. S. Russell of Toronto, Ontario, Canada sometime after 1870, and was subsequently adopted by Scottish stone manufacturer Andrew Kay. The granite for the stones comes from two sources: Ailsa Craig, an island off the Ayrshire coast of Scotland, and the Trefor\nby Henry Adamson. The sport was (and still is, in Scotland and Scottish-settled regions like southern New Zealand) also known as \"the roaring game\" because of the sound the stones make while traveling over the \"pebble\" (droplets of water applied to the playing surface). The verbal noun \"curling\" is formed from the Scots (and English) verb \"curl\", which describes the motion of the stone. Kilsyth Curling Club claims to be the first club in the world, having been formally constituted in 1716; it is still in existence today. Kilsyth also claims the oldest purpose-built curling pond in the world at\ngreat deal of strategy and teamwork go into choosing the ideal path and placement of a stone for each situation, and the skills of the curlers determine the degree to which the stone will achieve the desired result. This gives curling its nickname of \"chess on ice\". Evidence that curling existed in Scotland in the early 16th century includes a curling stone inscribed with the date 1511 uncovered (along with another bearing the date 1551) when an old pond was drained at Dunblane, Scotland. The world's oldest curling stone and the world's oldest football are now kept in the same\nGranite Quarry in Wales. Ailsa Craig is the traditional source and produces two types of granite, \"Blue Hone\" and \"Ailsa Craig Common Green\". \"Blue Hone\" has very low water absorption, which prevents the action of repeatedly freezing water from eroding the stone. \"Ailsa Craig Common Green\" is a lesser quality granite than \"Blue Hone\". In the past, most curling stones were made from \"Blue Hone\" but the island is now a wildlife reserve and the quarry is restricted by environmental conditions that exclude blasting. Kays of Scotland has been making curling stones in Mauchline, Ayrshire, since 1851 and has the\ncurlers often used 'irons' rather than stones until the early 1900s; Canada is the only country known to have done so, while others experimented with wood or ice-filled tins. Outdoor curling was very popular in Scotland between the 16th and 19th centuries because the climate provided good ice conditions every winter. Scotland is home to the international governing body for curling, the World Curling Federation in Perth, which originated as a committee of the Royal Caledonian Curling Club, the mother club of curling.

It incorporates the theme of the horror of war. \"Anthem for Doomed Youth\" employs the traditional form of a Petrarchan sonnet, but it uses the rhyme scheme of an English sonnet. Much of the second half of the poem is dedicated to funeral rituals suffered by those families deeply affected by the First World War. The poem does this by following the sorrow of common soldiers in some of the bloodiest battles, either the battle of the Somme, or the battle of\nthe first line of the poem: \"What passing-bells for these who die as cattle?\" The third album by British band The Libertines is named \"Anthems For Doomed Youth\", and features a song of the same name. American composer Stephen Whitehead included an orchestral setting of \"Anthem for Doomed Youth\" as a movement in his orchestral piece \"Three Laments on the Great War\" for soloists and orchestra. The piece is scored as a duet for mezzo-soprano and bass/baritone with orchestra. Anthem for Doomed Youth \"Anthem for Doomed Youth\" is a well-known poem written in 1917 by Wilfred Owen. It incorporates the\nPasschendaele, of the 20th century. Written between September and October 1917, when Owen was a patient at Craiglockhart War Hospital in Edinburgh recovering from shell shock, the poem is a lament for young soldiers whose lives were lost in the European War. The poem is also a comment on Owen's rejection of his religion in 1915. While in the hospital, Owen met and became close friends with another poet, Siegfried Sassoon. Owen asked for his assistance in refining his poems' rough drafts. It was Sassoon who named the start of the poem \"anthem\", and who also substituted \"dead\", on the\noriginal article, with \"doomed\"; the famous epithet of \"patient minds\" is also a correction of his. The amended manuscript copy, in both men's handwriting, still exists and may be found at the Wilfred Owen Manuscript Archive on the world wide web. The revision process for the poem was fictionalized by Pat Barker in her novel \"Regeneration\". The poem is among those set in the \"War Requiem\" of Benjamin Britten. During live performances of the song \"Paschendale\", Iron Maiden singer Bruce Dickinson often recites the first half of the poem.

The wine is produced in a variety of styles ranging from dry wines which can be consumed on their own as an aperitif, to sweet wines more usually consumed with dessert. Madeira is deliberately heated and oxidised as part of its maturation process, resulting in distinctive flavours and an unusually long lifespan once a bottle is opened. Marsala wine is a wine from Sicily that is available in both fortified and unfortified versions. It was first produced in 1772 by an English merchant, John Woodhouse, as an inexpensive substitute for sherry and port, and gets its name from\nthe island's port, Marsala. The fortified version is blended with brandy to make two styles, the younger, slightly weaker \"Fine\", which is at least 17% abv and aged at least four months; and the \"Superiore\", which is at least 18%, and aged at least two years.

Marsala first received \"Denominazione di Origine Controllata\" (DOC) status in 1969. The DOC status is equivalent to PDO: most countries limit the use of the term \"Marsala\" to those wines that come from the Marsala area, to which the European Union grants Protected Designation of Origin (PDO) status. While the city's natives sometimes drink \"vintage\" Marsala, the wine produced for export is universally fortified similar to Port, Madeira and Sherry. Originally, this addition of alcohol was to ensure that\nit would last on long ocean voyages, but now it is made that way because of its popularity in foreign markets. The most credible version of the introduction of Marsala fortified wine to a wider range of consumers is attributed to the English trader John Woodhouse. In 1773, Woodhouse landed at the port of Marsala and discovered the local wine produced in the region, which was aged in wooden casks and tasted similar to Spanish and Portuguese fortified wines then popular in England. Fortified Marsala was, and is, made using a process called \"in perpetuum\", which is similar to the\nespecially prevalent in dishes served in Italian restaurants in the United States. Dry Marsala wine is used in savory cooking. A typical savory Marsala sauce, for example, involves reducing the wine almost to a syrup with onions or shallots, then adding mushrooms and herbs. One of the most popular Marsala recipes is chicken marsala, in which flour-coated pounded chicken breast halves are braised in a mixture of Marsala, butter, olive oil, mushrooms, and spices. Marsala is also used in some risotto recipes. Sweet Marsala wine is used to produce rich Italian desserts such as \"zabaglione\", tiramisu and shortcake. Marsala wine",

De Mestral designed a toy airplane\ninducted into the National Inventors Hall of Fame in 1999 for inventing hook and loop fasteners. De Mestral first conceptualized hook and loop after returning from a hunting trip with his dog in the Alps in 1941. After removing several of the burdock burrs (seeds) that kept sticking to his clothes and his dog's fur, he became curious as to how it worked. He examined them under a microscope, and noted hundreds of \"hooks\" that caught on anything with a loop, such as clothing, animal fur, or hair. He saw the possibility of binding two materials reversibly in a simple\nits fur. He then worked on inventing hook and loop fasteners for ten years starting in 1948. In 1955 he successfully patented hook and loop, eventually selling 60 million yards (about 55,000 km) a year through a multimillion-dollar company. George was married three times: to Jeanne Schnyder in 1932, Monique Panchaud de Bottens in 1949, and Helen Mary Dale.

Born in Kingston, Jamaica, Fraser-Pryce ascended to prominence in the 2008 Olympic Games when at 21 years old, the relatively unknown athlete became the first Caribbean woman to win 100 m gold at the Olympics. In 2012, she successfully defended her 100 m title, becoming the third woman to win two consecutive 100 m gold medals at the Olympics. After winning bronze at the 2016 Summer Olympics, she became the first woman in history to win 100 m medals at three consecutive\nOlympic Games. Fraser-Pryce won the 100 m gold medal in the 2009 IAAF World Championships, becoming the second female sprinter to hold both world and Olympic 100 m titles simultaneously (after Gail Devers). After winning the 2015 world title in 100 m, she is the only female to be crowned world champion over 100 m three times (2009, 2013, 2015). She is also the only female athlete to reign as both world and Olympic champion on separate occasions, when she won the 2008 Olympic and 2009 world titles, and then the 2012 Olympic and 2013 world titles).

Fraser-Pryce then went on to win the 200 m title in a time of 22.17, a time only she had bettered that entire year. It was Fraser-Pryce's first major title over that distance, and she became the first person to complete the 100 m/200 m double in 22 years.

The African name Cedi (1965-1967)\nequivalent to 1 cedi = 0.98 U.S. dollars and the rate to the dollar was maintained when the British pound was devalued in November 1967. Further pegs were set of $0.55 in 1971, $0.78 in 1972, and $0.8696 in 1973 before the currency was floated in 1978. High inflation ensued, and so the cedi was re-pegged at \u20b52.80 = $1.00. Inflation continued to eat away at the cedi's value on the black market. In the early 1980s, the government started cracking down hard on the retail of products at prices other than the official established sale price (price controls). This\ndevalued the new cedi, it was gradually phased out in 2007 in favor of the \"Ghana cedi\" at an exchange rate of 1:10,000.

Born in Hirzel, a rural area in the canton of Zurich, Switzerland, as a child she spent several summers near Chur in Graub\u00fcnden, the setting she later would use in her novels. In 1852, Johanna Heusser married Bernhard Spyri. Bernhard was a lawyer. Whilst living in the city of Z\u00fcrich she began to write about life in the country. Her first story, \"A Note on Vrony's Grave\", which\ndeals with a woman's life of domestic violence, was published in 1880; the following year further stories for both adults and children appeared, among them the novel \"Heidi\", which she wrote in four weeks. \"Heidi\" is the story of an orphan girl who lives with her grandfather in the Swiss Alps, and is famous for its vivid portrayal of the landscape. Her husband and her only child, named Bernhard, both died in 1884. Alone, she devoted herself to charitable causes and wrote over fifty more stories before her death in 1901. She was interred in the family plot at the\nin that it depicts Heidi as a teenager during World War I, despite the fact that the original novel (where Heidi is only five years old) was published in 1881. In April 2010, a Swiss professorial candidate, Peter Buettner, uncovered a book written in 1830 by the German author Hermann Adam von Kamp. The 1830 story is titled \"Adelaide: The Girl from the Alps\" (German: \"Adelaide, das M\u00e4dchen vom Alpengebirge)\". The two stories share many similarities in plot line and imagery. Spyri biographer Regine Schindler said it was entirely possible that Spyri may have been familiar with the story as\ndifferent or not in \"Adelaide\", at all. The following is a list of her main books: Her books were originally written in German. The translations into English at the end of the 19th century, or the early 1900s, mention H. A. Melcon (1839-1910), Marie Louise Kirk (1860-1936), Emma Stelter Hopkins, Louise Brooks, Helen B. Dole and the couple Charles Wharton Stork and Elisabeth P. Stork.

The book was taken seriously at the time, and was a minor bestseller that created alarm in parents and galvanized them to campaign for censorship.

Subsequent to the publication of \"Seduction of the Innocent\", the Comics Code Authority was voluntarily established by publishers to self-censor their titles.\nintact bibliography are rare. Early complete editions of \"Seduction of the Innocent\" often sell for high figures among book and comic book collectors. Beginning in 1948, Wertham wrote and spoke widely, arguing about the detrimental effects that comics reading had on young people. Consequently, \"Seduction of the Innocent\" serves as a culminating expression of his sentiments about comics and presents augmented examples and arguments, rather than wholly new material. Wertham's concerns were not limited to comics' impact on boys: He also expressed a concern for the effect of impossibly proportioned female characters on girl readers. A. David Lewis writes that\n\"Seduction of the Innocent\" cited overt or covert depictions of violence, sex, drug use, and other adult fare within \"crime comics\" \u2013 a term Wertham used to describe not only the popular gangster/murder-oriented titles of the time, but superhero and horror comics as well. The book asserted that reading this material encouraged similar behavior in children. Comics, especially the crime/horror titles pioneered by EC, were not lacking in gruesome images; Wertham reproduced these extensively, pointing out what he saw as recurring morbid themes such as \"injury to the eye\".

His best-known book is \"Seduction of the Innocent\" (1954), which asserted that comic books caused youth to become delinquents. Besides \"Seduction of the Innocent\", Wertham also wrote articles and testified before government inquiries into comic books, most notably as part of a U.S. Congressional inquiry into the comic book industry. Wertham's work, in addition to the 1954 comic book hearings led to creation of the Comics Code, although later scholars cast doubt on his observations.

Emerson's work not only influenced his contemporaries, such as Walt Whitman and Henry David Thoreau, but would continue to influence thinkers and writers in the United States and around the world down to the present. Notable thinkers who recognize Emerson's influence include Nietzsche and William James, Emerson's godson. There is little disagreement that Emerson was the most influential writer of 19th-century America, though these days he is largely the concern of scholars. Walt Whitman, Henry David\nThoreau and William James were all positive Emersonians, while Herman Melville, Nathaniel Hawthorne and Henry James were Emersonians in denial\u2014while they set themselves in opposition to the sage, there was no escaping his influence. To T. S. Eliot, Emerson's essays were an \"encumbrance.\" Waldo the Sage was eclipsed from 1914 until 1965, when he returned to shine, after surviving in the work of major American poets like Robert Frost, Wallace Stevens and Hart Crane.

He was seen as a champion of individualism and a prescient critic of the countervailing pressures of society, and he disseminated his thoughts through dozens of published essays and more than 1,500 public lectures across the United States. Emerson gradually moved away from the religious and social beliefs of his contemporaries, formulating and expressing the philosophy of transcendentalism in his 1836 essay \"Nature\". Following this work, he gave a speech\noutstanding as the best of Emerson's essays, which Bloom listed as \"Self-Reliance\", \"Circles\", \"Experience\", and \"nearly all of \"Conduct of Life\"\".

As an alkaline earth metal, calcium is a reactive metal that forms a dark oxide-nitride layer when exposed to air. Its physical and chemical properties are most similar to its heavier homologues strontium and barium. It is the fifth most abundant element in Earth's crust and the third most abundant metal, after iron and aluminium.

The\nmembranes as well as proper bone formation. Calcium is a very ductile silvery metal (sometimes described as pale yellow) whose properties are very similar to the heavier elements in its group, strontium, barium, and radium. A calcium atom has twenty electrons, arranged in the electron configuration [Ar]4s. Like the other elements placed in group 2 of the periodic table, calcium has two valence electrons in the outermost s-orbital, which are very easily lost in chemical reactions to form a dipositive ion with the stable electron configuration of a noble gas, in this case argon. Hence, calcium is almost always divalent\nname derives from Latin \"calx\" \"lime\", which was obtained from heating limestone. Some calcium compounds were known to the ancients, though their chemistry was unknown until the seventeenth century. Pure calcium was isolated in 1808 via electrolysis of its oxide by Humphry Davy, who named the element. Calcium compounds are widely used in many industries: in foods and pharmaceuticals for calcium supplementation, in the paper industry as bleaches, as components in cement and electrical insulators, and in the manufacture of soaps. On the other hand, the metal in pure form has few applications due to its high reactivity; still, in\nsmall quantities it is often used as an alloying component in steelmaking, and sometimes, as a calcium\u2013lead alloy, in making automotive batteries. Calcium is the most abundant metal and the fifth-most abundant element in the human body. As electrolytes, calcium ions play a vital role in the physiological and biochemical processes of organisms and cells: in signal transduction pathways where they act as a second messenger; in neurotransmitter release from neurons; in contraction of all muscle cell types; as cofactors in many enzymes; and in fertilization. Calcium ions outside cells are important for maintaining the potential difference across excitable cell\nAbout three-quarters of dietary calcium is from dairy products and grains, the rest being accounted for by vegetables, protein-rich foods, fruits, sugar, fats, and oil. Calcium supplementation is controversial, as the bioavailability of calcium is strongly dependent on the solubility of the salt involved: calcium citrate, malate, and lactate are highly bioavailable while the oxalate is much less so. The intestine absorbs about one-third of calcium eaten as the free ion, and plasma calcium level is then regulated by the kidneys.

After the death of Louis-Auguste C\u00e9zanne that same year, C\u00e9zanne and his wife separated, the artist moving in with his sister and mother and declaring, \"My wife only cares for Switzerland and lemonade\".

The first European to have visited Tahiti according to existing records was lieutenant Samuel Wallis, who was circumnavigating the globe in , sighting the island on 18 June 1767, and eventually harbouring in Matavai Bay. This bay was situated on the territory of the chiefdom of Pare-Arue, governed by Tu (Tu-nui-e-a'a-i-te-Atua) and his regent Tutaha, and the chiefdom of Ha'apape, governed by Amo and\nBay before returning to Point Venus where he met Tu, the paramount chief. Cook picked up two passengers from Tahiti during this trip, Porea and Ma'i, with Hitihiti later replacing Porea when Cook stopped at Raiatea. Cook took Hitihiti to Tahiti on 22 April, during his return leg. Then, Cook departed Tahiti on 14 May 1774. Pautu and Tetuanui returned to Tahiti with Bonechea aboard \"Aguila\" on 14 November 1774, Tipitipia and Heiao having passed away in the interim. Bonechea died on 26 January 1775 in Tahiti, and was buried near the Spanish mission at Tautira Bay. Lt. Tomas Gayangos",

He was the first prime minister and president of Ghana, having led the Gold Coast to independence from Britain in 1957. An influential advocate of Pan-Africanism, Nkrumah was a founding member of the Organisation of African Unity and winner of the Lenin Peace Prize in 1962. After twelve years abroad pursuing higher education, developing his political philosophy, and organising with other diasporic pan-Africanists, Nkrumah returned to the Gold Coast to begin his political career as an advocate of national independence. He formed\nthe Convention People's Party, which achieved rapid success through its unprecedented appeal to the common voter. He became prime minister in 1952 and retained this position when Ghana declared independence from Britain in 1957. In 1960, Ghanaians approved a new constitution and elected Nkrumah president. His administration was both socialist and nationalist. Thus it funded national industrial and energy projects, developed a strong national education system, and promoted a national (and pan-African) culture. Under Nkrumah, Ghana played a leading role in African international relations during the decolonisation period. He was deposed in 1966 by the National Liberation Council which, under\n28 April 1961, 43 men were massacred in a surprise attack by the Congolese army. Ghana also gave military support to rebels fighting against Ian Smith's white-minority government in Rhodesia (now Zimbabwe), which had unilaterally declared independence from Britain in 1965.

Nkrumah also became a symbol for black liberation in the United States.

The play premiered on Broadway in February 1949, running for 742 performances, and has been revived on Broadway four times, winning three Tony Awards for Best Revival. It is widely considered to be one of the greatest plays of the 20th century. Willy Loman returns home exhausted after a business trip he has cancelled.

Drama critic John Gassner wrote that \u201cthe ecstatic reception accorded \"Death of Salesman\" has been reverberating for some time wherever there is an ear for theatre,\nand it is undoubtedly the best American play since \"A Streetcar Named Desire\".\u201d The play reached London on July 28, 1949. London responses were mixed, but mostly favorable. \"The Times\" criticized it, saying that \u201cthe strongest play of New York theatrical season should be transferred to London in the deadest week of the year.\u201d However, the public understanding of the ideology of the play was different from that in America. Some people, such as Eric Keown, think of \"Death of a Salesman\" as \"a potential tragedy deflected from its true course by Marxist sympathies.\" The play was hailed as \u201cthe\nmost important and successful night\u201d in Hebbel-Theater in Berlin. It was said that \u201cit was impossible to get the audience to leave the theatre\u201d at the end of the performance. The Berlin production was more successful than New York, possibly due to better interpretation.

        "question": "Who brought up Achilles' mother?",
        "text": "Achilles In Greek mythology, Achilles or Achilleus ( ; , \"Achilleus\" ) was a Greek hero of the Trojan War and the central character and greatest warrior of Homer's \"Iliad\". His mother was the immortal Nereid Thetis, and his father, the mortal Peleus, was the king of the Myrmidons. Achilles' most notable feat during the Trojan War was the slaying of the Trojan hero Hector outside the gates of Troy. Although the death of Achilles is not presented in the \"Iliad\", other sources concur that he was killed near the end of the Trojan War by Paris, who shot him\nthen commands that Achilles' battle prize Briseis, the daughter of Briseus, be brought to him to replace Chryseis. Angry at the dishonour of having his plunder and glory taken away (and, as he says later, because he loves Briseis), with the urging of his mother Thetis, Achilles refuses to fight or lead his troops alongside the other Greek forces. At the same time, burning with rage over Agamemnon's theft, Achilles prays to Thetis to convince Zeus to help the Trojans gain ground in the war, so that he may regain his honour. As the battle turns against the Greeks, thanks\na prophecy (originally uttered by Themis, goddess of divine law) that Thetis would bear a son greater than his father. For this reason, the two gods withdrew their pursuit, and had her wed Peleus. There is a tale which offers an alternative version of these events: In the \"Argonautica\" (4.760) Zeus' sister and wife Hera alludes to Thetis' chaste resistance to the advances of Zeus, pointing out that Thetis was so loyal to Hera's marriage bond that she coolly rejected the father of gods. Thetis, although a daughter of the sea-god Nereus, was also brought up by Hera, further explaining\nher resistance to the advances of Zeus. Zeus was furious and decreed that she would never marry an immortal. According to the \"Achilleid\", written by Statius in the 1st century AD, and to non-surviving previous sources, when Achilles was born Thetis tried to make him immortal by dipping him in the river Styx. However, he was left vulnerable at the part of the body by which she held him: his left heel (see Achilles' heel, Achilles' tendon). It is not clear if this version of events was known earlier. In another version of this story, Thetis anointed the boy in\nechoes that of Achilles and Hector over Patroclus, except that Memnon (unlike Hector) was also the son of a goddess. Many Homeric scholars argued that episode inspired many details in the \"Iliad\"s description of the death of Patroclus and Achilles' reaction to it. The episode then formed the basis of the cyclic epic \"Aethiopis\", which was composed after the \"Iliad\", possibly in the 7th century BC. The \"Aethiopis\" is now lost, except for scattered fragments quoted by later authors. The exact nature of Achilles' relationship with Patroclus has been a subject of dispute in both the classical period and modern",

He is the Supreme Being within Shaivism, one of the major traditions within contemporary Hinduism. Shiva is known as the \"Creator, maintainer and the destroyer\" within the Trimurti, the Hindu trinity that includes Brahma and Vishnu. In Shaivism tradition, Shiva is the Supreme being who creates, protects and transforms the universe. In the tradition of Hinduism called Shaktism, the Goddess, or Devi, is described as supreme, yet Shiva is revered along with Vishnu and Brahma. A goddess is stated to be the\ndeities treated as same). Hinduism also accepts numerous divine beings, with many Hindus considering the deities to be aspects or manifestations of a single impersonal absolute or ultimate reality or God, while some Hindus maintain that a specific deity represents the supreme and various deities are lower manifestations of this supreme. Other notable characteristics include a belief in existence of \u0101tman (soul, self), reincarnation of one's \u0101tman, and karma as well as a belief in dharma (duties, rights, laws, conduct, virtues and right way of living). McDaniel (2007) classifies Hinduism into six major kinds and numerous minor kinds, in order\nand Roman deities, as was the idea of this aniconic column linking heaven and earth among early Indo-Aryans, states Roger Woodward. Others contest such proposals, and suggest Shiva to have emerged from indigenous pre-Aryan tribal origins. Shiva as we know him today shares many features with the Vedic god Rudra, and both Shiva and Rudra are viewed as the same personality in Hindu scriptures. The two names are used synonymously. Rudra, the god of the roaring storm, is usually portrayed in accordance with the element he represents as a fierce, destructive deity.

He started in 1963 with the group the Wailers and forged a distinctive songwriting and vocal style that became popular with audiences worldwide. The Wailers released some of the earliest reggae records with producer Lee \"Scratch\" Perry. The Wailers disbanded in 1974, and Marley pursued a solo career upon his relocation to England which culminated in the release of the album \"Exodus\" in 1977, which established\nMiami at age 36 of melanoma. He was a committed Rastafari who infused his music with a sense of spirituality. He is credited with popularising reggae music around the world and served as a symbol of Jamaican culture and identity. He has become a global symbol and has inspired a significant merchandise industry. Bob Marley was born 6 February 1945 on the farm of his maternal grandfather in Nine Mile, Saint Ann Parish, Jamaica, to Norval Sinclair Marley (1885\u20131955) and Cedella Booker (1926\u20132008).

He has had six consecutive number one albums in the UK and his tally of 62 UK hit singles includes 31 that reached the top ten, six of which gained the #1 position. Stewart has had 16 top ten singles in the US, with four reaching #1 on the \"Billboard\" Hot 100.

Bob Marley's full name is Robert Nesta Marley, though some sources give his birth name as Nesta Robert Marley, with a story that when Marley was still a boy a Jamaican passport official reversed his first and middle names because Nesta sounded like a girl's name. Norval provided financial support for his wife and child but seldom saw them as he was often away. Bob Marley attended Stepney\nand Peter Tosh. In 1966, Marley married Rita Anderson, and moved near his mother's residence in Wilmington, Delaware in the United States for a short time, during which he worked as a DuPont lab assistant and on the assembly line at a Chrysler plant in nearby Newark, under the alias Donald Marley. Though raised as a Catholic, Marley became interested in Rastafari beliefs in the 1960s, when away from his mother's influence.

His work is characterised by a raw Scots dialect and brutal depiction of Edinburgh life. He has also written plays and screenplays, and directed several short films. Irvine Welsh was born in Leith, the port area of the Scottish capital Edinburgh. He states that he was born in 1958, though, according to the Glasgow police, his birth record is dated around 1951. When he was four, his family moved to Muirhouse,\nAcid House\", where the minds of a baby and a drug user swap bodies, or \"The Granton Star Cause\", where God transforms a man into a fly as punishment for wasting his life. Welsh adapted three of the stories for a later film of the same name, in which he also appeared. Welsh's third book (and second novel), \"Marabou Stork Nightmares\", alternates between a grim tale of thugs and schemes in sub-working class Scotland and a hallucinatory adventure tale set in South Africa. Gradually, common themes emerge. His next book, \"\" (1996), became his most high-profile work since \"Trainspotting\", released\na play, and a film adaptation, directed by Danny Boyle and written by John Hodge, was released in 1996. Welsh appeared in the film in the minor role of drug dealer Mikey Forrester. The novel has since achieved a cult status, aided by the popularity of the film. Next, Welsh released \"The Acid House\", a collection of short stories from \"Rebel Inc.\", \"New Writing Scotland\" and other sources. Many of the stories take place in and around the housing schemes from \"Trainspotting\", and employ many of the same themes; a touch of fantasy is apparent in stories such as \"The\nsociology.\" Welsh's novels share characters, giving the feel of a \"shared universe\" within his writing.

It is famous for being the birthplace of Vice Admiral Horatio Nelson, victor at the Battle of Trafalgar and one of Britain's greatest heroes. At the time of his birth, Nelson's father, Edmund Nelson, was rector of the church in Burnham Thorpe. The house in which Nelson was born was demolished soon after his father's death, though the rectory that replaced it and the church at which his father preached can still be seen. The site of the\nformer rectory is marked by a roadside plaque. The village's main public house was built in 1637 and was known as \"The Plough\" until 1798 when it was renamed \"The Lord Nelson\" in honour of the victory at the Battle of the Nile. Nelson held a dinner here for the men of the village prior to his departure to join . The pub survives to this day.

Burnham Thorpe Burnham Thorpe is a small village and civil parish on the River Burn and near the coast of\nNelson's Column in Trafalgar Square, London, and the Nelson Monument in Edinburgh, have been created in his memory and his legacy remains highly influential. Horatio Nelson was born on 29 September 1758 in a rectory in Burnham Thorpe, Norfolk, England, the sixth of eleven children of the Reverend Edmund Nelson and his wife Catherine Suckling. He was named after his godfather Horatio Walpole (1723\u20131809) then 2nd Baron Walpole, of Wolterton. His mother, who died on 26 December 1767, when he was nine years old, was a great-niece of Robert Walpole, 1st Earl of Orford, the \"de facto\" first Prime Minister\nGloucester, Swansea, Monmouth and numerous other towns and villages. Nelson often found himself received as a hero and was the centre of celebrations and events held in his honour. In 1802, Nelson bought Merton Place, a country estate in Merton, Surrey (now south-west London) where he lived briefly with the Hamiltons until William's death in April 1803. The following month, war broke out again and Nelson prepared to return to sea. Nelson was appointed commander-in-chief of the Mediterranean Fleet and given the first-rate as his flagship. He joined her at Portsmouth, where he received orders to sail to Malta and\nCaribbean. The marriage was registered at Fig Tree Church in St John's Parish on Nevis. Nelson returned to England in July, with Fanny following later. Nelson remained with \"Boreas\" until she was paid off in November that year. He and Fanny then divided their time between Bath and London, occasionally visiting Nelson's relations in Norfolk. In 1788, they settled at Nelson's childhood home at Burnham Thorpe. Now in reserve on half pay, he attempted to persuade the Admiralty and other senior figures he was acquainted with, such as Hood, to provide him with a command. He was unsuccessful as there",

Many interpreters liken the undulating form of his reclining figures to the landscape and hills of his birthplace, Yorkshire. Moore was born in Castleford, the son of a coal miner. He became well-known through his carved marble and larger-scale abstract cast bronze sculptures, and was instrumental in introducing a particular form of modernism to the United Kingdom. His ability in later life to fulfil large-scale commissions made him exceptionally wealthy. Despite this, he lived frugally; most of the money he earned went towards endowing the Henry Moore Foundation, which\nwhere he began modelling in clay and carving in wood. He professed to have decided to become a sculptor when he was eleven after hearing of Michelangelo's achievements at a Sunday School reading. On his second attempt he was accepted at Castleford Grammar School, which several of his siblings had attended, where his headmaster soon noticed his talent and interest in medieval sculpture. His art teacher broadened his knowledge of art, and with her encouragement, he determined to make art his career; first by sitting for examinations for a scholarship to the local art college.

Henry Moore was born in Castleford, West Riding of Yorkshire, England, to Mary Baker and Raymond Spencer Moore. His father was of Irish origin and became pit deputy and then under-manager of the Wheldale colliery in Castleford. He was an autodidact with an interest in music and literature. Determined that his sons would not work in the mines, he saw formal education as the route to their advancement. Henry was the seventh of eight children in a family that often struggled with poverty. He attended infant and elementary schools in Castleford,\na plaque for the Scott Society at Castleford Secondary School, and a Roll of Honour commemorating the boys who went to fight in the First World War from the school \u2013 were executed around this time. Despite his early promise, Moore's parents had been against him training as a sculptor, a vocation they considered manual labour with few career prospects. After a brief introduction as a student teacher, Moore became a teacher at the school he had attended. Upon turning eighteen, Moore volunteered for army service.

He is often referred to as the \"Father of Medicine\" in recognition of his lasting contributions to the field as the founder of the Hippocratic School of Medicine.

However, the\nfrom improper balance of the four humors. Hippocrates, known as the \"Father of Modern Medicine\", established a medical school at Cos and is the most important figure in ancient Greek medicine. Hippocrates and his students documented numerous illnesses in the \"Hippocratic Corpus\", and developed the Hippocratic Oath for physicians, which is still in use today. The contributions to ancient Greek medicine of Hippocrates, Socrates and others had a lasting influence on Islamic medicine and medieval European medicine until many of their findings eventually became obsolete in the 14th century. The earliest known Greek medical school opened in Cnidus in 700\nwidely considered to be the \"Father of Medicine\". His contributions revolutionized the practice of medicine; but after his death the advancement stalled. So revered was Hippocrates that his teachings were largely taken as too great to be improved upon and no significant advancements of his methods were made for a long time. The centuries after Hippocrates' death were marked as much by retrograde movement as by further advancement. For instance, \"after the Hippocratic period, the practice of taking clinical case-histories died out,\" according to Fielding Garrison. After Hippocrates, the next significant physician was Galen, a Greek who lived from AD\ndedicated medicinal treatment facilities for patients are found. In Greece, the Greek physician Hippocrates, the \"father of modern medicine\", laid the foundation for a rational approach to medicine. Hippocrates introduced the Hippocratic Oath for physicians, which is still relevant and in use today, and was the first to categorize illnesses as acute, chronic, endemic and epidemic, and use terms such as, \"exacerbation, relapse, resolution, crisis, paroxysm, peak, and convalescence\". The Greek physician Galen was also one of the greatest surgeons of the ancient world and performed many audacious operations, including brain and eye surgeries. After the fall of the Western\nachievements of the writers of the Corpus, the practitioners of Hippocratic medicine and the actions of Hippocrates himself were often commingled; thus very little is known about what Hippocrates actually thought, wrote, and did. Hippocrates is commonly portrayed as the paragon of the ancient physician, and credited with coining the Hippocratic Oath, which is still relevant and in use today. He is also credited with greatly advancing the systematic study of clinical medicine, summing up the medical knowledge of previous schools, and prescribing practices for physicians through the Hippocratic Corpus and other works.

From 1870 to 1965 the city had a second major station, Princes Street, operated by the rival Caledonian Railway, but this was never as important as Waverley. As at other large railway stations of the Victorian and Edwardian eras, the railway company constructed a grand station hotel beside their station.

In 1983 British Rail sold it to the Forte hotel group. In 1988\nthe Caledonian Railway railway station later built at the West End which was named Princes Street station from 1870. In 1868 the North British Railway acquired the stations of its rivals, demolished all three, and closed the Scotland Street tunnel to Canal Street.

In 2009, Quebec began to mark the day (Canadian French: \"Jour de la Marmotte\") with its own groundhog. The observance of Groundhog Day in the United States first occurred in German communities in Pennsylvania, according to known records.

It derives from the Pennsylvania Dutch superstition that if a groundhog (Deitsch: \"Grundsau\", \"Grunddax\", \"Dax\") emerging from its burrow on this day sees a shadow due to clear weather, it will retreat to its den and winter will persist for six more weeks, and if it does not see its shadow because of cloudiness, spring will arrive early.

The first reported news of a Groundhog Day observance was arguably made by the \"Punxsutawney Spirit\" newspaper of Punxsutawney, Pennsylvania in 1886: \"up to the time of going to press, the beast has not seen its shadow\". However, it was not until the following year in 1887 that the first Groundhog Day considered \"official\" was commemorated here, with a group making a trip to the Gobbler's Knob part of town to consult the groundhog.

Candlemas concurs with Imbolc, one of the Celtic 'cross-quarter days', the four days which marked the midpoints between solstice and equinox. Scholar Rhys Carpenter in 1946 emphasized that the Badger Day tradition was strong in Germany, but absent in the British Isles (England, Scotland, Wales, or Ireland), and he referred to this as a reason that the U.S. Groundhog Day was not brought by immigrants from these places. There did exist a belief among Roman Catholics in Britain that the hedgehog predicted the\nhunt and \"Groundhog Feast\", which took place annually in September. The \"hunt\" portion of it became increasingly a ritualized formality, because the practical procurement of meat had to occur well ahead of time for marinating.

Christopher Jones is believed to have been born in Harwich, Essex about 1570, although baptismal records are blank for his parish church for the period of time between April 1565 and June 1571. He was the son of Christopher Jones, Sr. and his wife Sybil. The senior Jones was also a mariner and ship owner who died in 1578, leaving to his young son, bearing his name, his interest in the ship \"Marie\nclassed as 'gentlemen' whose land was valued at a certain per annum value. Apparently Jones had prospered but had not reached the class of 'gentleman'. In August 1609 records first note Christopher Jones as master and part owner of the \"Mayflower\" when his ship was chartered for a voyage from London to Drontheim (Trondheim) in Norway, and back to London. Due to bad weather, on her return the ship lost an anchor and made short delivery of her cargo of herrings. Litigation was involved and was proceeding in 1612. In a document of January 1611, Christopher Jones is described as\nfor an Atlantic voyage seemed to come at a most opportune time. In addition to wine and wool, with Jones as captain the \"Mayflower\" had transported hats, hemp, Spanish salt, hops and vinegar to Norway and he may have taken the ship whaling in the North Atlantic in the Greenland area. Jones had traveled to Mediterranean Sea ports, being then part owner with Nichols, Robert Child, Thomas Short. In 1620 Capt. Jones and Robert Child still owned their quarter shares in the ship, and it was from them that Thomas Weston chartered her in the summer of 1620 to undertake\nbeing 'of Harwich', and his ship is called the \"Mayflower\" of Harwich (in Essex co.). Then about 1611, Jones decided to leave Harwich and moved south to London, where he made his home in Rotherhithe parish, a mile downstream on the Thames from the Tower of London. By that time, Jones had likely traded the ship Josian for a quarter-share in the smaller ship \"Mayflower\". In 1611 Christopher Jones is recorded as removing to Rotherhithe parish, then in Surrey, now in London. This was his home until his death in 1622. Records of Jones' ship \"Mayflower\" have the ship in\nwhere sea captains and merchants ran the local government and levied their own taxes on the citizens to take care of town business. In his mid-thirties Jones was somewhat of a prominent Harwich citizen and was named as a burgess of Harwich in a new town charter granted by King James. Jones was coming into his own about this time, and with an assist from a bounty, he built a 240-ton, larger than average ship of his own which he named after his second wife \u2013 Josian. Jones used the ship for trading voyages as far south as to Bordeaux",

The city proper has an area of 960.6 km (371 mi) and an estimated population of 1,606,000 in 2009, with 2,800,000 in its metropolitan area in 2006. Situated in northeastern Zimbabwe in the country's Mashonaland region, Harare is a metropolitan province, which also incorporates the municipalities of Chitungwiza and Epworth. The city sits on a plateau at an elevation of above sea level and its climate falls into the subtropical highland category. The city was founded in 1890 by the Pioneer Column, a\non 11 November 1965, and proclaimed the Republic of Rhodesia in 1970. Subsequently, the nation became the short-lived state of Zimbabwe Rhodesia, it was not until 18 April 1980 that the country was internationally recognised as independent as the Republic of Zimbabwe. The name of the city was changed to Harare on 18 April 1982, the second anniversary of Zimbabwean independence, taking its name from the village near Harare Kopje of the Shona chief Neharawa, whose nickname was \"he who does not sleep\". Prior to independence, \"Harare\" was the name of the black residential area now known as Mbare.

Company administrators demarcated the city and ran it until Southern Rhodesia achieved responsible government in 1923. Salisbury was thereafter the seat of the Southern Rhodesian (later Rhodesian) government and, between 1953 and 1963, the capital of the Central African Federation. It retained the name Salisbury until 1982, when it was renamed Harare on the second anniversary of Zimbabwean independence. Harare is Zimbabwe's leading political, financial, commercial, and communications centre, as well as a trade centre for tobacco, maize, cotton, and\ncitrus fruits. Manufacturing, including textiles, steel, and chemicals, are also economically significant, as is local gold mining. The University of Zimbabwe, the country's oldest university, is located in Harare, as are several other colleges and universities. The city is home to Harare Sports Club, the country's main Test cricket ground, as well as Dynamos F.C., the country's most successful association football team. Harare's infrastructure and government services have worsened in recent years, and the city has been ranked as one of the least livable cities out of 140 assessed.

The elected council was replaced by a government-appointed commission for alleged inefficiency, but essential services such as rubbish collection and street repairs have rapidly worsened, and are now virtually non-existent. In May 2006 the Zimbabwean newspaper the \"Financial Gazette\", described the city in an editorial as a \"sunshine city-turned-sewage farm\".

On 6 June 1900 the \"Times\" of London used the term \"rebellion\" in quotation marks, presumably to indicate their view that the rising was in fact instigated by Empress Dowager Cixi. The historian Lanxin Xiang refers to the \"so called 'Boxer Rebellion,'\" and explains that \"while peasant rebellion was nothing new in Chinese history, a war against the world's most powerful states was.\" The name \"Boxer Rebellion\", concludes Joseph Esherick, another recent historian, is truly a \"misnomer\", for\nJoseph Esherick comments that \"confusion about the Boxer Uprising is not simply a matter of popular misconceptions\", for \"there is no major incident in China's modern history on which the range of professional interpretation is as great\". Chinese liberals such as Hu Shi often condemned the Boxers for their irrationality and barbarity. Dr. Sun Yat-sen, the founding father of the Republic of China and of the Nationalist Party at first believed that the Boxer Movement was stirred up by the Qing government's rumors, which \"caused confusion among the populace\", and delivered \"scathing criticism\" of the Boxers' \"anti-foreignism and obscurantism\".

Passepied had first been composed under the name \"Pavane\", while Clair de lune was originally titled \"Promenade sentimentale\". These names also come from Paul Verlaine's poems. The final title of \"Suite bergamasque\" comes from Verlaine's poem \"Clair de lune\", which refers to bergamasks in its opening stanza: The \"Suite bergamasque\" consists of four movements: The first piece in the suite is entitled \"Pr\u00e9lude\", in the key of F and marked \"tempo rubato\". It is full of dynamic contrasts with\ntook many years to develop his mature style, and was nearly 40 when he achieved international fame in 1902 with the only opera he completed, \"Pell\u00e9as et M\u00e9lisande\". Debussy's orchestral works include \"Pr\u00e9lude \u00e0 l'apr\u00e8s-midi d'un faune\" (1894), \"Nocturnes\" (1897\u20131899) and \"Images\" (1905\u20131912). His music was to a considerable extent a reaction against Wagner and the German musical tradition. He regarded the classical symphony as obsolete and sought an alternative in his \"symphonic sketches\", \"La mer\" (1903\u20131905). His piano works include two books of Pr\u00e9ludes and two of \u00c9tudes. Throughout his career he wrote \"m\u00e9lodies\" based on a wide variety\nregarded \"Pr\u00e9lude \u00e0 l'apr\u00e8s-midi d'un faune\" (1894) as his first orchestral masterpiece. Newman considered it \"completely original in idea, absolutely personal in style, and logical and coherent from first to last, without a superfluous bar or even a superfluous note\"; Pierre Boulez observed, \"Modern music was awakened by \"Pr\u00e9lude \u00e0 l'apr\u00e8s-midi d'un faune\"\". Most of the major works for which Debussy is best known were written between the mid-1890s and the mid-1900s. They include the String Quartet (1893), \"Pell\u00e9as et M\u00e9lisande\" (1893\u20131902), the \"Nocturnes for Orchestra\" (1899) and \"La mer\" (1903\u20131905). The suite \"Pour le piano\" (1894\u20131901) is, in Halford's\nwithin a score and the desire to create discontinuity in a way mirrored in later 20th century music. In this piece, Debussy abandoned the whole-tone scale he had often favoured previously in favour of the octatonic scale with what the Debussy scholar Fran\u00e7ois Lesure describes as its tonal ambiguities. Among the late piano works are two books of \"Pr\u00e9ludes\" (1909\u201310, 1911\u201313), short pieces that depict a wide range of subjects.

In his observations regarding the Egyptians, he establishes Greco-Egyptian equivalents that endured into the Hellenistic era, including Amon/Zeus, Osiris/Dionysus, and Ptah/Hephaestus. In his observations regarding the Scythians, he equates their queen of the gods, Tabiti, to Hestia, Papaios and Api to Zeus and Gaia respectively, and Argimpasa to Aphrodite Urania, whilst also claiming that the Scythians worshipped equivalents to Herakles and Ares, but which he doesn't name. Some pairs of Greek and Roman gods, such as Zeus and Jupiter, are thought\na distinctly Roman development, as when Augustus made Apollo one of his patron deities. In the early period, Etruscan culture played an intermediary role in transmitting Greek myth and religion to the Romans, as evidenced in the linguistic transformation of Greek \"Heracles\" to Etruscan \"Her[e]cle\" to Roman \"Hercules\". The phrase \"interpretatio romana\" was first used by the Imperial-era historian Tacitus in the \"Germania\". Tacitus reports that in a sacred grove of the Nahanarvali, \"a priest adorned as a woman presides, but they commemorate gods who in Roman terms \"(interpretatione romana)\" are Castor and Pollux.\" Elsewhere, he identifies the principal god\nAthena Athena or Athene, often given the epithet Pallas, is an ancient Greek goddess associated with wisdom, handicraft, and warfare, who was later syncretized with the Roman goddess Minerva.

From her origin as an Aegean palace goddess, Athena was closely associated with the city.

For instance, when the myths or even cult practices of a particular Roman deity were influenced by the Greek or Etruscan tradition, the deity may have had an independent origin and a tradition that is culturally distinctive. From the Roman point of view, it was natural to apply the above principle also to the Jewish God Jehovah and equate him with Jupiter. However, the Jews \u2013 unlike other people living under Roman\nto derive from a common Indo-European archetype (Dyeus as the supreme sky god), and thus exhibit shared functions by nature. Others required more expansive theological and poetic efforts: though both Ares and Mars are war gods, Ares was a relatively minor figure in Greek religious practice and deprecated by the poets, while Mars was a father of the Roman people and a central figure of archaic Roman religion. Some deities dating to Rome's oldest religious stratum, such as Janus and Terminus, had no Greek equivalent.

Manufacturers of cola drinks add trace flavorings to create distinctively different tastes for each brand.

A variety of different sweeteners may be added to cola, often partly dependent on local agricultural policy. High-fructose corn syrup (HFCS) is predominantly used in the United States and Canada due to the lower cost of government-subsidized corn.

This fish is also caught in the Bay of Bengal and in the South China Sea, although in smaller numbers.

After drying, the odour of the fish is extremely powerful, and it is usually transported in air-tight containers. The Bombay duck is a popular food item in certain areas of India.\nis said to have associated the pungent smell with that of the newspapers and mail which would come into the cantonments from Bombay. The term was later popularized among the British public by its appearance in Indian restaurants in the UK.

Beyond what is found in the writings of Luther and some of his contemporaries, little is known about her. Despite this, Katharina is often considered one of the most important participants of the Reformation because of her role in helping to define Protestant family life and setting the tone for clergy marriages. Katharina von Bora was the daughter to\nwas the daughter of a Jan von Bora auf Lippendorf and his wife Margarete, whose family name has not been established. Both were only specifically mentioned in the year 1505. It is certain that her father sent the five-year-old Katharina to the Benedictine cloister in Brehna in 1504 for education. This is documented in a letter from Laurentius Zoch to Martin Luther, written on October 30, 1531. This letter is the only evidence for Katharina von Bora's time spent within the monastery. At the age of nine she moved to the Cistercian monastery of Marienthron (Mary's Throne) in Nimbschen, near\nGrimma, where her maternal aunt was already a member of the community. Katharina is well documented at this monastery in a provision list of 1509/10. After several years of religious life, Katharina became interested in the growing reform movement and grew dissatisfied with her life in the monastery. Conspiring with several other nuns to flee in secrecy, she contacted Luther and begged for his assistance. On Easter Eve, 4 April 1523, Luther sent Leonhard K\u00f6ppe, a city councilman of Torgau and merchant who regularly delivered herring to the monastery. The nuns successfully escaped by hiding in K\u00f6ppe's covered wagon among\nthe fish barrels, and fled to Wittenberg. A local student wrote to a friend: 'A wagon load of vestal virgins has just come to town, all more eager for marriage than for life. God grant them husbands lest worse befall.\" Luther at first asked the parents and relations of the refugee nuns to admit them again into their houses, but they declined to receive them, possibly as this was participating in a crime under canon law. Within two years, Luther was able to arrange homes, marriages, or employment for all of the escaped nuns\u2014except for Katharina. She first was housed\nthe sick alongside other nurses. Luther called her the \"boss of Zulsdorf,\" after the name of the farm they owned, and the \"morning star of Wittenberg\" for her habit of rising at 4 a.m. to take care of her various responsibilities.
